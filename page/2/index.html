difficulties of public health strategies. One makes particularly obvious the
severe misanthropic consequences of profit seeking drives in the areas of
health and medicine, and the second is a remarkable case point in the
iatrogenic potential of public health interventions which may be completely
benevolent in intention &ndash; something that all states irrespective of political
structure must address. Part one is contained below, you can find part two (here)[]</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 18, 2024</time>

Linked to it via Paul Cockshott.</p><h2 id=the-question>The Question</h2><p>That said this is a question that is not absurd a priori. As we’ll see, the
Roman Empire was never close to an industrial revolution – a great many of the
preconditions were missing – but the idea that it might have been on the cusp
of being something like a modern economy did once have its day in the
scholarship. As I’ve mentioned before, the dominant feature of the historical
debate among scholars about the shape of the Roman economy is between
‘modernists’ who argue the Roman economy is relatively more like a modern
economy (meaning both that it was relatively more prosperous than other ancient
economies but also that the Romans themselves maintained a more modern,
familiar outlook towards money, investment and production) and ‘primitivsts’
who argue that actually the Roman economy was quite primitive, less prosperous
and with the Romans themselves holding attitudes about the economy quite alien
to our own. But here we need to get into a bit more specificity because beneath
that quick description it is necessary to separate what we might call the ‘old
modernists’ and the ‘new modernists.’</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 8, 2024</time>

almost nothing for the next thirty-five years. Dorothy Sayers abandoned Lord Peter Wimsey

Author and reader
may well ask why they should be republished just now. At first sight they might seem to
lack all topicality. Subject and tone alike may appear remote to a considerable section of
public opinion. I believe, however, that they have some topicality in that, without
entering upon any detailed polemics, they represent a point of view in opposition to
certain literary and philosophical trends still very much to the fore today.
Let us begin with the general atmosphere: the clouds of mysticism which once
surrounded the phenomena of literature with a poetic colour and warmth and created
an intimate and ‘‘interesting’’ atmosphere around them, have been dispersed. Things
now face us in a clear, sharp light which to many may seem cold and hard; a light shed
on them by the teachings of Marx. Marxism searches for the material roots of each
phenomenon, regards them in their historical connections and movement, ascertains the
laws of such movement and demonstrates their development from root to flower, and in
so doing lifts every phenomenon out of a merely emotional, irrational, mystic fog and
brings it to the bright light of understanding.</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>September 29, 2023</time>

insofar as it per- ceives capitalism dialectically, as a social total- ity that
includes modes of production, relations of production, and the pragmatically
evolving ensemble of institutions and ideologies that lubricate and propel its
reproduction. From this perspective, Marxism’s most important contri- bution to
making sense of race and racism in the United States may be demystification. A
histori- cal materialist perspective should stress that “race”—which includes
“racism,” as one is unthinkable without the other—is a historically specific
ideology that emerged, took shape, and has evolved as a constitutive element
within a definite set of social relations anchored to a par- ticular system of
production.</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>September 24, 2023</time>

Nightmares: Suburbia, 1870-1930&rdquo;. I would say it speaks for itself.</p><p>Many subdividers also employed restrictions to exclude
‘‘undesirable’’ people as well as &ldquo;undesirable&rdquo; activities. By far the
most common of these provisions were racial covenants. Under
a typical covenant, an owner was forbidden to sell or lease the
property to a member of any of a number of allegedly undesirable
racial, ethnic, or religious groups. He or she was also forbidden
to allow a member of these groups, other than chauffeurs, gardeners, or domestic servants, to use or occupy the property. A few
subdividers had employed racial covenants in the mid-nineteenth
century. In Brookline, for example, one forbade &ldquo;any negro or
native of Ireland&rdquo; to occupy a dwelling, and in Baltimore another
barred the sale or lease of a house to &ldquo;a negro or person of African
or Mongolian [that is, Asian] descent.&rdquo; But such restrictions were
very much the exception before the 1890s. Indeed, not even the
most racist subdividers imposed racial covenants. A case in point
was Francis G. Newlands, the mining magnate and U.S. senator
who laid out Chevy Chase in the early 1890s. Newlands saw the
United States as &ldquo;the home of the white race.&rdquo; To him, &ldquo;race tolerance&rdquo; meant &ldquo;race amalgamation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;race intolerance&rdquo; meant
&ldquo;race war.&rdquo; Fusing the racism of the South with the racism of the
West, he called for repealing the Fifteenth Amendment, thereby
denying African-Americans, &ldquo;an inferior race,&rdquo; the right to vote,
and restricting immigration to &ldquo;the white race,&rdquo; thereby excluding Chinese, Japanese, and other Asians. Despite his outspoken racism, Newlands did not include racial covenants among the
minimum cost requirements and other restrictions he imposed
on the first subdivisions at Chevy Chase.</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>July 9, 2023</time>

societies. A considerable part of our morality and our lives
themselves are still permeated with this same atmosphere of
the gift, where obligation and liberty intermingle. Fortunately,
everything is still not wholly categorized in terms of buying
and selling. Things still have sentimental as well as venal value,
assuming values merely of this kind exist. We possess more
than a tradesman morality. There still remain people and
classes that keep to the morality of former times, and we
almost all observe it, at least at certain times of the year or
on certain occasions.</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>June 11, 2023</time>

how you wear your hair, or whether you eat pig’s feet[, or whether you want to

inspection]. But to substitute this “how I feel, what my thing is,” for

fight. In fact, the Socialist movement is one of the few movements which has the

&ldquo;Restoration in Russia: Why Capitalism Failed&rdquo;. The work is both a valuable
reflection of, and look into, the tumultuous years following the dissolution of
the USSR.</p><p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t hammer in a bolt.&rsquo; This was among the slogans used by the
pro-government political bloc Russia&rsquo;s Choice in its campaign for the
parliamentary elections of December 1993. Spokespeople for the bloc explained
to voters: it&rsquo;s pointless to dream of a just society, so you have to reconcile
yourself to the new order. The slogan turned out to be unintentionally ironic.
The attempts by Yelstin, Gaidar and the other Russian &lsquo;reformers&rsquo; to construct
liberal capitalism in a country where there is neither a normal bourgeoise, nor
a market infrastructure, were a case of &lsquo;hammering a bolt&rsquo;.</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 6, 2023</time>
