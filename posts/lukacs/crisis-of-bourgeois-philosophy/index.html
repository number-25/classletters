The concept of
“crisis” has long taken root in bourgeois philosophy. When, for example,
Siegfried Marck, a famous neo-Hegelian, wanted to define Rickert’s place in the
development of philosophy, he called him a thinker of the “pre-crisis era.”
Indeed, if we carefully trace the development of bourgeois philosophy in recent
decades, we will see that literally every two years the foundations of
philosophy are again and again called into question. It is no coincidence that
this development was initiated by Nietzsche’s program: a reassessment of all
values. This continues endlessly in modern philosophy; a year during which a
crisis did not break out in some area of philosophy is a year without any
events.</p><p>But the most serious symptom of the crisis is the fact that at the end of this
development stands the so-called “worldview” of fascism. And it can be argued
that the resistance that was launched against it by bourgeois philosophy is
equal to zero. Even the popularity of a significant part of those philosophical
trends that fascism completely and undividedly contained in itself (think at
least about Nietzscheanism), remained, as before, in wide circles of opponents
of Nazism completely inviolable.</p><p>So, the fact of the crisis can hardly be disputed. It is more difficult to
characterize it and carry out criticism from a historical and, in a narrow
sense, from a philosophical point of view. Here the question immediately
arises: what in the philosophy of the era of imperialism turns out to be
specifically new, is it radically new, and if so, how much?</p><p>In such matters, we need to be careful. During the debates over the program of
the Russian Communist Party, Lenin protested against the opinion shared by some
that when analyzing the economic structure and laws of imperialism, one could
supposedly abstract from them the general development of capitalism. I believe
that this methodological statement of Lenin’s remains valid in the ideological
and philosophical sphere. The philosophy of imperialism can be understood and
criticized only within the framework of the general interconnections of
capitalist society. After all, there is no doubt that, despite all the
modifications, the impact of universal economic foundations is also expressed
in philosophy.</p><p>We can observe this relationship even at the most superficial level; for
example, in the fact that modern philosophy constantly uses the systems of the
past. So, in particular, the influence of Kant is obvious up to Chamberlain and
through him to Rosenberg; Sartre uses Descartes, while German irrationalism
asserts that modern philosophy, starting with Descartes, has gone astray, etc.
In this eternal, restless search for more and more primary sources, signs of
crisis also appear – on a historical scale. After all, these indecisive
searches, this uncertainty betray an irresistible feeling that philosophy has
gone astray.</p><p>Where and when did it get lost? Where should it go back to find the right path?</p><h2 id=i-fetishized-thinking-and-reality>I. Fetishized thinking and reality</h2><p>What’s new in the philosophy of the era of imperialism? On the whole, it is a
mental reflection of imperialism itself as the highest and therefore the most
contradictory stage of capitalism. The contradictions of capitalist society,
which until now determined the path of development, the form and content of
bourgeois philosophy, are now revealed at the height of their objective
contradiction. This means not just a corresponding aggravation, since for the
bourgeois class not to recognize this fundamental contradiction is a matter of
life and death.</p><p>Objectively, the deeper and more insurmountable the contradictions are, the
faster becomes the process leading to the emergence of a crisis: the separation
of development paths from philosophical thinking and social reality. But here
we are also talking about something else. The problem lies not only in the
opposition between the world of bourgeois thinking and the social reality of
imperialism, but also in the real, essential course of development of this
social reality and in the immediately visible surface that hides this reality.
Therefore, perhaps, thinkers who, in the final analysis, are honest, in their
writings completely turn social reality upside down, since they slavishly
adhere to this deceptive surface.</p><p>This opposition is an inevitable problem in bourgeois thinking. The fundamental
ideological form of the phenomena of capitalist society is fetishization. This
means, in a nutshell, that for individuals living in the vicious circle of
superficial phenomena of capitalist society, relations between people, although
often mediated by things, appear as things; human relations are reified,
fetishized. The most obvious, elementary form of this fetishization is one of
the fundamental phenomena of capitalist production, the commodity. A commodity,
both in its origin and in its further functioning as a commodity, is a
mediating link in specific human relations (capitalist and worker, buyer and
seller). There must be absolutely specific social, economic circumstances, that
is, completely specific human relations, so that the result of human labor, the
product of the labor of human hands, becomes a commodity. As long as the
capitalist social order hides these interconnections, makes them impenetrable
and it is increasingly obscured by the fact that the commodity form of a
product is only a reflection of a specific relationship between people, these
relationships crystallize and become independent characteristics of the
commodity (for example, price), they turn out to be characteristics of things,
like some natural characteristics, they seem to be inherent in the commodity,
like the sweetness of sugar or the color of a rose. And the farther a
phenomenon is from real production, the more empty, soulless becomes a fetish,
and the more it materializes, the more significantly it takes possession of
thinking at the same time. The imperialist development of the capitalist world,
in particular the transformation of finance capital into a governing force,
increasingly intensifies the general fetishization, and the more difficult and
unpromising becomes the task of exposing reification, since the
interrelationships that underlie this fetishization as essential are more and
more obscured by fog.</p><p>Here it is important for philosophy that getting stuck in fetishization means
moving in an anti-dialectical direction. The more often society in bourgeois
thinking turns out to be a chaotic accumulation of dead things and material
relationships, and not – in accordance with reality – a continuous and
continuously changing reproduction of relations between people (classes), the
more unfavorable for dialectical thinking such a position should become. This
process, which begins in this way, is further intensified by the parasitism of
the imperialist era. Most of the intelligentsia is so far removed from the
labor process that determines the real structure and laws of movement of
society, is so deeply embedded in the world of secondary or tertiary phenomena
of aggregate social production, which it perceives as primary, that the
intellectual exposure of fetishization becomes downright impossible.</p><p>That is, the distance of thoughts reflecting surface phenomena from reality is
so great that any change in social development reveals itself to thinking as an
unexpected, gaping abyss, manifests itself as a crisis, as an endless series of
crises.</p><p>But if we assert that there is a constant philosophical crisis within
imperialism, then, on the other hand, we must still distinguish between
separate stages: before 1914, the philosophical crisis is relatively latent;
and only after 1918 it becomes obvious to everyone.</p><h2 id=ii-major-eras-of-bourgeois-thinking>II. Major eras of bourgeois thinking</h2><p>All this is just a general ideological characteristic of the era of
imperialism. However, philosophy is a special ideological form, the development
of which does not always parallel the development of other ideological forms,
for example, the exact sciences or literature. The peculiarity of philosophy
consists, in short, in particular of its very subject, which covers existence
and the ultimate questions of cognition, that is, a worldview raised to an
abstract and generalized level. Whereas where the immediate subject is the
immediately given social (or natural) reality (and not just its abstract
embodiment, its generalized principles), a bold and impartial consideration of
reality can often correct worldview distortions. For example, we often see in
literature how individual writers, otherwise enclosed together with their
opinions within a fetishized worldview, de-fetishize through their writings,
through the depiction of life and reality what seemed to them a thing
perceptible as a human relationship. In contrast, philosophy deals with the
latter principles; here the material does not create such opposition. Its
subject does not give the possibility of such a correction that breaks through
the personal limited opinion of the thinker.</p><p>Based on these considerations, we can now try to identify the main epochs in
the development of bourgeois philosophy, so that with the help of this
historical survey we can more clearly understand the special distinguishing
features of the epoch of imperialism.</p><p>The first era is classical bourgeois philosophy lasts somewhere until the end
of the first third of the 19th century, up to a maximum until 1848. At this
time, the most perfect intellectual expression of the bourgeois worldview, the
intellectual denial of the feudal social order and its culture arises.
Philosophy formulates the fundamental principles and universal worldview of
this great, progressive liberation movement that is transforming society. A
revolutionary breakthrough is taking place in logic, in the natural and social
sciences, which expresses the universal nature of philosophy – the fact that it
takes a fruitful part in solving key specific problems of the natural and
social sciences and, on their basis, rises to the highest generalizations. This
gives it the character of universality, fruitful for the sciences and opening
up great prospects.</p><p>What is this philosophy from the class point of view? The answer, it would
seem, is simple, but in specific circumstances it is unusually confused: after
all, it is the great universal world-historical interests of the class that is
objectively called upon to transform the entire social world in a progressive
direction to its very foundations. These interests are expressed in the works
of classical philosophy. Therefore, this philosophy is closely connected with
the great, world-historically significant goals and with the battles that are
being fought for their implementation. This is the origin of a powerful and
heightened sense of reality among the great thinkers of this era. Even the
mistakes of these thinkers are mistakes of a world-historical nature, since
they stem from heroic illusions necessary from the point of view of world
history.</p><p>From such a strong and deep intertwining of philosophers with the
world-historical interests of the emerging bourgeois class follows their
relative independence from momentary class tactics and especially from
individual estates of this class. This provides serious opportunities for
criticism. Criticism comes from within, since it is based on the great
historical vocation of its own class, which gives philosophers the courage to
clearly and decisively take a definite position. However, since this courage is
not just individual, because, on the contrary, it is based in the most serious
way on the connection of thinkers with the class they represent, insofar as,
acting on behalf of this world-historical vocation, they are full of pathos in
the awareness of the need to sharply criticize deviations from the necessary
world-historical path.</p><p>The revolution of 1830, and even more so the revolution of 1848, testifies to
the fact that the bourgeoisie has ceased to be the leading progressive class.
Thus, the process of disintegration of classical bourgeois philosophy begins,
which completed itself with the revolution of 1848. Thus, philosophy is
entering a new phase of development, which continued somewhere before the
beginning of the era of imperialism. The onslaught of the bourgeois class
against feudal remnants has come to an end; in relation to the rapidly rising
proletariat defensive positions are taken. Another very important process of
the era of bourgeois revolutions, the formation of national states, ended in
the same way, and the formation of German and Italian national unity took place
in a reactionary form. This time was the era of oppressive class compromises,
the era of Napoleon III and Bismarck. The old bourgeois democracy has been
steadily declining since 1848 and even disintegrating. Liberalism and democracy
sharply diverge, oppose each other in a hostile way; liberalism turns into
conservative “national liberalism.” The economic background of this process of
the disintegration of democracy is the rapid offensive of capitalist production
in Western and Central Europe. It would seem that from now on capitalism will
move forward without any problems and boundaries. (These considerations do not
apply to Russia. In economic and political development, and as a result of this
also in the ideological struggle in Russia, 1905, by and large, corresponds to
1848 in Western and Central Europe. Therefore, in the second half of the 19th
century, such thinkers like Chernyshevsky and Dobrolyubov could still live in
Russia.)</p><p>The philosophy of this era is an intellectual reflection of class compromise.
Philosophy refuses to answer key worldview questions. Agnosticism has become an
intellectual, theoretical and cognitive expression of this tendency: we cannot
know anything about the true essence of the world, reality, and it does not
matter at all whether we know anything about it. What is important is that
individual knowledge which is developed and accumulated by the isolated from
each other special sciences and which serves to find absolutely necessary
satisfactory solutions to problems that arise in everyday practical life. The
role of philosophy is limited to ensuring that no one crosses the established
boundaries of cognition of the essence, so that no one draws such conclusions
from the economic and social sciences that would question capitalism as the
only blessed social order, or might conflict with religious beliefs. This
philosophy fundamentally rejects the worldview question as a question that
science cannot approach, that is insoluble in the scientific sense.</p><p>Of course, this philosophy, which is mainly expressed in the form of
neo-Kantianism or positivism, is not the only philosophy of this era, it just
occupies a dominant position there. Along with it, experiments have been
carried out for some time on the last, philosophically defective renewal of the
old mechanistic materialism (Moleschott, Büchner, etc.); along with it,
especially in intellectual circles, Schopenhauer is extremely important as a
philosophical exponent of the ideas of hopeless pessimism, who proclaimed the
renunciation of a completely meaningless life.</p><p>The dominant philosophy is the philosophy of the professors
(Kathederphilosophie). Along with psychology that was developing then, its
content was almost entirely the theory of knowledge. Philosophy itself becomes
a special science, and this is just the other side of the decisive, principled
rejection of any ideological issues. Thus, it renounces its former social role
of being a form of intellectual expression of the great world-historical
interests of the developing class. Due to the fact that it is ready to occupy a
borderline ideological post, necessary for the then bourgeoisie and inevitable
from the point of view of a lasting class compromise with the reaction, the
bourgeoisie is becoming increasingly indifferent to individual steps and
results, methods and content of “special philosophical science.” The
bourgeoisie fully entrusts the elaboration of these details to the
intelligentsia, and in the first place to the intelligentsia involved in the
bureaucracy, in the state apparatus. So this stratum, which has become
relatively independent in accordance with the developing capitalist division of
labor, turns into a social carrier of such a new philosophy.</p><p>However, this independence is very relative; its sine qua non is the faithful
performance of the aforementioned “border post” service. Thus, in a new period
in the development of bourgeois philosophy, the intelligentsia, which has
become relatively independent, turns into a social agent of philosophy, and the
form and content of philosophy, in fact, are determined by the special problems
of this stratum. However, in that era, not only did the spirit of philosophy
radically change, but (in what precisely determines the change in its spirit)
the social function of the intelligentsia, directly creating philosophy, did
not remain the same. Previously, it spoke on behalf of the great
world-historical perspectives of the progressive, nascent bourgeoisie. These
prospects were destroyed during the defensive battles that were fought against
the proletariat, within the class compromise after 1848. The philosophical
claims of the bourgeois class have narrowed to principles that draw clear
boundaries, have become negative. Within these boundaries, the intelligentsia
and individuals belonging to it could, as it seemed, move relatively freely,
without being attached to anything. Philosophy became more and more an internal
affair of the intelligentsia. The bourgeoisie is completely indifferent to what
doctrines individual professors proclaim, provided that they adhere to the
boundaries that have been set for philosophy. Philosophical departments are
sinking deeper and deeper into the vacuum of social indifference.</p><p>How does the philosophy of the era of imperialism relate to its predecessors?
It would seem that the rise begins. Philosophy again becomes “interesting,” of
course, only for wider circles of the intelligentsia. The bourgeois class will
remain extremely indifferent to it in the future. From an external point of
view, the new philosophy acts as an opponent of Kathederphilosophie, which
continues to live to this day, and to a large extent in the old style. Many
leading philosophers of this time spoke outside the universities (Nietzsche,
Spengler, Keyserling, Klages). Simmel and Scheler have also been outsiders for
a long time. Gradually, the new trend spreads to some universities, and there
“interestingness” also becomes a principle of choice (Croce, Bergson, Huizinga,
etc.). Has there been a radical change here? We believe not. In fact, there was
an even greater shift in the direction that emerged after 1848: the
intelligentsia makes philosophy for the intelligentsia. However, even here, as
we will see later in a detailed analysis, a strictly bourgeois
class-determinism exists, but now it does not act as a factor that directly
determines the forms and content, but as a reflection of the space of
possibilities of movement that corresponds to this class and is limited by
virtue of its interests, in which the intelligentsia, it would seem, can freely
create. This class definiteness takes a concrete form in fascism. Fascism
translates all “achievements” of imperialist philosophy into the most
reactionary language of the national and social demagogy of monopoly
capitalism, the most reactionary of all; from the pulpits, from salons, from
the coffee shops, fascism brings them out into the streets.</p><h2 id=iii-old-and-new-in-the-philosophy-of-the-era-of-imperialism>III. Old and new in the philosophy of the era of imperialism</h2><p>What does the “interestingness” thus arising, the relative independence of
philosophy mean? It means that the bourgeois intelligentsia proceeds from its
special position, touches upon its own special problems, and more decisively,
more consciously than in the times preceding imperialism. (Here the fact is
also expressed that now the role of the free intelligentsia is more significant
in comparison with the role of the bureaucratic intelligentsia of the previous
era.) Proceeding from this, philosophy poses its own individual concrete
questions, which from time to time are in apparent opposition to the bourgeois
class, although the reserved zone of bourgeois class interests is still
completely seeure.</p><p>What follows from what has been said regarding the content and form of the new
philosophy? First of all, we see that the basis of bourgeois existence is never
subjected to any genuine criticism. After all, the knowledge of the economic
foundations of bourgeois society among representatives of the new philosophy is
increasingly declining, even a simple intention to seriously get acquainted
with them and critically examine them as philosophical problems is becoming
increasingly rare. At the same time, the voice of criticism seems to grow
louder, but this criticism concerns almost exclusively private morality and
culture in a narrower sense, that is, those issues that most directly concern
the intelligentsia. This consistent evasion, avoiding any problems of the
economy, society, social life is precisely the strict observance of boundaries,
established by the imperialist bourgeoisie for the field to which philosophy
extends, and thereby provided it with a platform, free space for its special
problems, in which it could again be “interesting” and even make revolutionary
gestures. (This evasion of economic, social problems, problems of social life,
although it coincides objectively with the class requirements of the
imperialist bourgeoisie, at the same time it spontaneously grows out of the
very existence of the intelligentsia in the society of the imperialist era.
Therefore, it is possible that some philosophers unconsciously submitted to the
wishes of the imperialist bourgeoisie in spite of the faithful observance of
the boundaries set by the class; however, objectively this is the case, even if
subjectively it happened for some unconsciously and with the best intentions.)</p><p>But this is precisely why the fundamental independence, the fundamental
critical attitude, will become increasingly weaker (think, for example, of
Hobbes, Rousseau, or Fichte in the classical era). There are many utopias about
the transformation of culture, perhaps in a “more revolutionary” form than
Nietzsche’s, but the economic and political foundations of capitalism remain
intact. Nietzsche most sharply criticizes the cultural symptoms of the
capitalist division of labor, but he, however, does not intend to encroach on
the capitalist system of labor itself.</p><p>The focus of philosophical criticism, often with a “revolutionary” sweep taken
almost to the extreme, is the criticism of the idea of progress. However, no
one says (in many cases, neither the thinker nor his intelligent public knows
anything about this) that such a “risky” statement of the question is only an
ideological reflection of the hostile bourgeoisie towards the progress of
development, its compromise with reactionary remnants of society that this
question in the era of imperialism takes on such acute forms because within
imperialist monopoly capitalism the alliance of the leading class of capitalist
production with all reactionary social forces is significantly strengthened.
Reactionary content and revolutionary gestures form an original and curious
marriage. Let’s think about Lagarde, Nietzsche, Sorel, Ortega y Gasset. On the
eve of the seizure of power by fascism, Hans Freyer summed up the results in a
short slogan: revolution on the right.</p><p>In connection with this development, in parallel with the fact that worldview
issues come to the fore, the attitude of philosophy to religion is also
changing. In the previous era, agnostic boundaries served only to make
materialist atheism philosophically impossible and discredit it. The turn to a
positivist worldview leads partly to a new justification of religion, partly to
the creation of a new religious atheism, whose worldview and moral content,
however, forms the complete opposite of materialist atheism. We can trace these
changes from Nietzsche to the existentialism of Heidegger and Sartre.</p><p>At the same time, in the era of imperialism, the natural sciences, in the main
direction of their popularization, are turning into a weapon of the reactionary
world outlook. In the preceding epoch, reactionary philosophy initially took a
defensive position here. Agnosticism, “ignorabimus” by Emile du Bois-Reymond,
was just one more counterweight to the worldview conclusions of Haeckel’s
materialism. However, in the school of Mach-Avenarius-Poincaré, an open defense
of reactionary views was spreading. In the era of imperialism, this trend was
constantly increasing, philosophy interpreted each new achievement in the field
of natural sciences as confirmation of a reactionary worldview, supposedly
based on facts.</p><p>Speaking about the theoretical and cognitive basis of all these phenomena, it
should be noted: the subjective idealism of the previous era is still the main
theory of knowledge. This is not an accident, since idealism is a “natural,”
spontaneously growing worldview of the intelligentsia, especially the free
intelligentsia. Labor, which ultimately determines people’s attitude to the
world, in its essence has a double bottom: labor itself demonstrates a state of
affairs in which the existence of the material world does not depend on
consciousness; but at the same time, any labor process has a teleological
character, that is, a person is aware of a mentally imagined goal before the
material labor process begins. As the intelligentsia is increasingly moving
away from the material process of labor, in her consciousness, to an ever
increasing degree, the second moment is almost exclusively at work. The more
the intellectual class is removed from real labor, from practical contact with
the material categories of reality, the more this motive affects it. Therefore,
it may happen that natural scientists in their special work – often contrary to
their own philosophical convictions – turn out to be spontaneous materialists.
Rickert, for example, regrets that prominent scientists in their field have
recognized themselves as supporters of “naive realism.” The wider the
independent, special role of the intelligentsia in philosophy becomes, the more
significant is subjective idealism in the theory of knowledge.</p><h2 id=iv-pseudo-objectivity>IV. Pseudo-objectivity</h2><p>But even if we assert that this theoretical and cognitive basis remained
intact, at the same time, we must take into account that – in comparison with
the previous era – there has been a significant change in the philosophy of the
era of imperialism. The most important moments of this change are: a feigned
striving for objectivity, then, the struggle against the formalism of the
theory of knowledge, its apparent overcoming and the associated triumph of
mystical intuition, which is brought into the spotlight as a new instrument of
philosophical knowledge, and, finally, a new formulation of the ideological
question instead of the consistent agnosticism of the previous era.</p><p>All these moments arise from the needs of the era of imperialism. They are all
symptoms of a crisis in philosophy. Satisfaction with the eternal, seemingly
unshakable social environment, the appearance of a calm social and political
upsurge (the so-called Sekuritat, that is, security) formed such a spiritual
attitude and such a course of action in philosophy that made it possible to
convey all substantive problems (all reality) to special sciences, industrial
development and, last but not least, to the “wise managers” of the state
apparatus, of course, with strict observance of theoretical and cognitive
boundaries.</p><p>The fact that the need for a worldview comes to the fore is already a sign of a
crisis, or at least a harbinger of it. It is felt that, despite the apparent
stabilization, even the strengthening of the surface, the foundations were
shaken. Most importantly, the intellectual class, inclined to philosophical
generalizations, reacts sensitively to the impending crisis; long before 1914,
this problem was becoming tangible in a significant part of imperialist
philosophy. One way or another, by this time the signs of the crisis have
finally become universal; they are embodied mainly in anxiety about the
preservation of the integrity of individuals in the face of disunity due to the
capitalist division of labor, in the discovery of insoluble contradictions,
arising within the capitalist and imperialist culture (however, here the
contradictions of capitalist culture are not discussed, as elsewhere, but the
contradictions of culture as a whole). The most prominent exponent of the
philosophy of this latent crisis is Simmel.</p><p>It may sound paradoxical if we say that the need for a worldview is a sign of a
crisis. But the truth, as always, is concrete. Therefore, let us look at the
social function of the question of worldview in the three eras of bourgeois
thinking described above. A powerful, comprehensive worldview developed in
classical bourgeois philosophy; philosophy at that time was the most
influential, basic and generalizing science, and in accordance with this, the
worldview was the last content of scientific philosophy, which organically
ascended on the rise of bourgeois society and which led scientific activity at
certain stages of development to its highest point and completed it. The
economically favorable epoch of class compromises cowardly and sluggishly
turned away from any ideological issue, considered dealing with these issues
excessive, characterized, with a shrug, the desire for the worldview of the
previous great era as unscientific. In contrast to this, the intelligentsia,
irresistibly approaching a crisis and ultimately dragged into a whirlpool of
crises, rapidly replacing each other, hoped to find in the ideology, which it
fanned out to a worldview, consolation, reassurance and reconciliation with
fate.</p><p>But, thus, we again come to a paradox: how can the gloomy pessimism of
Nietzsche or Spengler, Klages or Heidegger provide consolation? This paradox is
originally inherent in the impact of philosophical idealism due to the fact
that idealism – in an anti-historical, abstract spirit – depicts the special
fate of a person in the era of imperialism as an eternal fate and creates a
philosophical method that acts in a similar way. After all – as paradoxical as
it may sound – it is in such resignation to fate that consolation lies; think
about amor fati (love of fate) in Nietzsche, about life directed towards death
in Heidegger, about “heroically” embellished pessimism and fatalism in
proto-fascism (Spengler) and among the fascists, etc. (Schopenhauer and
Kierkegaard are the harbingers of these directions). People are not expected to
be satisfied when there is no reason for this, when for thinking people the
feeling of satisfaction is completely impossible. Although it should not be
forgotten that modern thinkers, such as Keyserling or Jaspers, have pointed to
a similar closed private life that excludes any sociality, which is satisfied
with itself, the ideological basis of which is built precisely on deep
pessimism in relation to the general world process.</p><p>At the same time, the dissatisfaction caused by the crisis never turns against
the capitalist foundations. The bourgeois intelligentsia, under the impression
of the crisis, does not oppose the economic and social order of capitalism.
This once again testifies to the fact that the nucleus of modern philosophy
lies within the intelligentsia itself. Here, the direct and crude praise of the
capitalist order no longer comes to the fore, as was the case with hired and
voluntary agents. On the contrary, one of the central philosophical themes, the
importance of which, moreover, is increasing is the seeming criticism of
capitalist culture, always oriented only towards secondary symptoms. During the
crisis, the ideology of the “third way” increasingly brings to the fore in the
public sense the worldview in which it is declared, that neither capitalism nor
socialism is the correct direction for the development of mankind. (By default,
the precondition of this concept is the recognition that it is impossible to
theoretically defend the capitalist order as it is.) Since capitalism becomes
philosophically indefensible directly, the purpose of the “third way” in the
philosophy of history is to keep the intelligentsia in crisis from making
socialist conclusions. Thus, this “third way” also becomes a pillar of
capitalism, its defense, only now it is not through direct, but through
indirect apologetics.</p><p>So, in the worldview of the era of imperialism, the struggle against socialism
is increasingly becoming its main problem; it is a philosophical struggle
against dialectical materialism, that is, both against materialism and against
dialectics. In terms of worldview, this means, first of all, the exclusion of
economic and social positions from philosophy. Since philosophy is not able to
make serious arguments against the social views of socialism, it poses the
question as if Marxist political economy had been “refuted long ago” by the
bourgeois economic sciences, and, thus, the task of philosophy is limited to
belittling the worldview significance of economic and social positions, to
slander them. And since bourgeois sociology is also “scientifically” isolated
from economics, as it becomes a completely separate science, the relationship
of philosophy to sociology is radically changed in comparison with the past.
The philosophy of that time refuted the scientific validity of sociology, the
current philosophy accepts it. Indeed, during an acute crisis, sociology is
increasingly becoming (mainly as the “sociology of knowledge” by Scheler and
Mannheim) even an instrument of worldview relativism. The often reactionary
sociology that emerged from it later (Fryer, Carl Schmitt) falls straight into
the fascist worldview.</p><p>Another theater of the ideological war in which the battle against socialism is
being fought is the deployment of philosophical theories hostile to progress.
Here we are also talking about the fact that bourgeois philosophy, since it
cannot bring up any serious and convincing counter-arguments against the
progressive prospects of socialism, seeks partly to destroy the ideas of
progress itself, both in the natural and social sciences, and partly to mystify
development, at the same time, it goes into those perspectives that become
comprehensible for the crisis-ridden intelligentsia and correspond, if not to
the real history, then at least to its [the intelligentsia’s – G. L.] dreams.
From the unification of the two trends in the ideology of fascism and its
predecessors, racial theory emerges as a mythical solution to the “secrets” of
society and history.</p><p>It is clear, firstly, that all this means a challenge to historical materialism
also in the event that we do not find in some particular philosopher an
explicit polemic against it. Secondly, the fact is that the socialist worldview
in Western and Central Europe did not have such a profound and powerful
influence on the intelligentsia as it should have been in accordance with the
general influence of the labor movement. This successful influence of bourgeois
philosophy was greatly facilitated by reformism. First of all, reformism
challenges the ideological character of Marxism; it considers Marx to be a
“narrow specialist” in economics and sociology, and such a narrow specialist,
whose methods and results of research, thanks to scientific development –
partially or completely – are already outstripped. Therefore, reformism is only
consistent when its ideologists try to “supplement” Marxism with Kant (Max
Adler) or Mach (Friedrich Adler); the most consistent representative of
reformism (Bernstein) takes a resolute anti-dialectical position, considering
dialectics an outdated and misleading method. There is strong opposition to
reformism as a political outlook in Central and Western Europe, but as a world
outlook, the defenders of dialectical materialism could not force themselves to
be heard seriously. This ideological weakness of the labor movement in Central
and Western Europe affected the world outlook of the still poorly represented
bourgeois-democratic, anti-imperialist opposition. And here there is no serious
resistance to the general reactionary philosophy of imperialism.</p><h2 id=v-the-third-way-and-myth>V. The “third way” and myth</h2><p>In this regard, we can move on to the main issues of the era of imperialism. To
begin with, let us examine the problem of objectivity that arises at the basis
of the subjective-idealistic theory of knowledge. We have already mentioned the
“third way” in the theory of knowledge. On the one hand, it appears in
Nietzsche, on the other, in Mach and Avenarius, from there it leads through
Husserl to the ontology of existentialism, which, although it recognizes an
existence independent of consciousness, nevertheless adheres to the old
idealistic methods in its definition, cognition and interpretation. The theory
of knowledge of the previous epoch resolutely rejected the cognizability of
objective reality. The “third way,” while retaining all the principles of the
subjective-idealistic theory of knowledge, blurs the boundaries and poses
questions as if ideas and concepts that exist only in consciousness are already
objective reality themselves.</p><p>What does that reality mean, that reality about which this philosophy is
talking? (Bourgeois philosophy always distinguishes between idealism and
“realism.” The word “materialism” is condemned and never uttered.) Mach and the
neo-Kantians, marking the transition to the era of imperialism, create a theory
of knowledge that makes terminological concessions to the practice of natural
scientists and together at the same time dulls the philosophical edge of their
“naive realism.” If, following Berkeley, we identify reality with
representation, then in this case, at least in the statements of philosophers,
there is only a uniform reality; but it is essentially identical with
subjective idealistic reality. Thus arising agnosticism is, however, radically
different from the agnosticism of the previous era. Engels could rightfully
call it “shy materialism,” since the doctrine of the unknowability of reality
would mean here only that philosophy did not even wish to comprehend the
achievements of the natural sciences in a world outlook. The Mach school goes
beyond this negative attitude; its agnosticism means that the achievements of
natural science are wholly and completely consistent with any reactionary
worldview.</p><p>However, development did not stop there either. In its modern form, agnosticism
turns into mysticism and myth-making. From this point of view, the figure of
Nietzsche is of decisive importance for the entire development of imperialism.
One could even say that he created a model for constructing myths for the
entire imperialist era. Here we can draw the reader’s attention only to some of
the leading motives. First of all, the role of “body” and “corporeality” should
be noted. Nietzsche breaks with the abstract “spirituality” of university
philosophy and its philistine morality. He invents such a theory of knowledge
and morality, which takes under the protection of the rights of sensual life
and yet does not compromise with philosophical materialism. It goes without
saying that the form of philosophy of such an immaterial body can only be
mythological.</p><p>But this is only a part of Nietzsche’s biologism and the psychology allegedly
growing out of it, which in Nietzsche takes the place of social science. This
foundation is supplemented and brought to its logical conclusion by the
mythical perspective of human development, the world process, the approval of
imperialism, the creation of a new aristocracy and opposition to socialism with
the help of a biological myth. (This laid the philosophical foundation for
racial theory.)</p><p>This is not the place to analyze other myths (Bergson, Spengler, Klages, etc.).
We just want to add some fundamental remarks. The myths that arise in this way
should not be confused with those elements of some ancient philosophical
teachings that, on a superficial examination, function as myth. Any idealism,
not being highly agnostic, immediately turns into a myth as soon as it tries to
explain real phenomena, for it is forced to ascribe a real role to mental
constructions in reality.</p><p>The more philosophy approaches objective idealism, the stronger the
construction becomes in it, turning into a myth. In Fichte’s “absolute I” it is
expressed more distinctly than in Kant’s “pure consciousness,” and in Hegel’s
“world spirit” it is even stronger than in Fichte’s. But even these mental
constructs, accepted as reality, still contain elements of its serious study.
Everywhere here one can recognize those real elements for which these
constructions are their first discovery and at the same time a mental
distortion. These thought constructs, which function as myths, create a
philosophical fog prior to the sunrise of true knowledge.</p><p>A completely opposite situation is unfolding in the philosophy of the era of
imperialism. The mental construction, the myth, turns here against the already
victorious scientific knowledge; the first task of the myth is to obscure the
social consequences of scientific knowledge. Already at the very beginning of
this development, this happens with the conclusions of Darwinism in the
mythologization of Nietzsche. The myth appears – with a certain naivety – not
as one of the parts of scientific cognition, as in the classical era, but as a
supposedly qualitatively higher one and, if necessary, disavowing scientific
attitude to the world.</p><p>The social function of this “worldview,” that is, the myth, is to instill a
socially acceptable picture of the world where science is unable to provide a
perspective, or, wherever the perspective of science is opposed to what is
defended by imperialist philosophy, to instill a socially acceptable picture of
the world, instead of scientifically contradicting it.</p><p>This is how the paradoxical essence of imperialist philosophy arises: on the
one hand, the agnostic subjective-idealist theory of knowledge remains
inviolable, on the other hand, diagnostics receives a completely new function;
by turning into a myth, by passing into a myth, it creates a new, imaginary
objectivity.</p><h2 id=vi-intuition-and-irrationalism>VI. Intuition and irrationalism</h2><p>The new concept of objectivity presupposes a new tool of cognition. The central
problem of the philosophy of the era of imperialism is what is cognition acting
in a new way and its instrument is intuition, which is opposed to conceptual,
rational thinking. In fact, it is the case that intuition constitutes the
psychological element of any working method of science. And with regard to
intuition, psychologically, there arises an immediate semblance that it is
supposedly more concrete, more synthetic than abstract, discursive thinking
that works with concepts. However, this is only an illusion, since from a
psychological point of view, intuition is nothing more than a sudden awareness
of an unconsciously occurring thought process.</p><p>And for conscientious scientific thought, a serious task will be, firstly,
verification of these intuitively achieved results in order to clarify their
scientific validity and, secondly, their organic introduction into the system
of rational concepts so that later it would be impossible to distinguish which
of them were discovered with the help of the discursive ability of a person
(that is, consciously), and which ones through intuition (which arises first at
the threshold of consciousness and only then becomes conscious). Intuition here
is, on the one hand, an addition to conceptual thinking, and in no way its
opposite; on the other hand, the intuitive detection of a connection will never
turn into a criterion of truth. With a superficial observation of the process
of scientific work, the illusion arises that intuition is an organ of cognition
independent of abstract thinking, designed to comprehend higher or deeper
relations.</p><p>This illusion, which is supported by the general subjectivism of the philosophy
of the era of imperialism, appears as a result of the acceptance of the
subjective working method for an objective method and becomes the basis of the
modern theory of intuitionism. This illusion, due to the substitution taking
place here, rises to dialectical knowledge. From a subjectivist perspective, it
is reasonable to assume that dialectical contradiction is realized on the path
of concepts, while we owe intuition to its synthetic resolution and release
into a higher unity. Of course, this is an illusion, for real dialectics
expresses each of its synthesis only with the help of concepts, and none of its
synthesis can be considered as a final given. Genuine scientific dialectical
thinking, since it is a correct reflection of objects of the real world, always
contains conceptual connection and conceptual analysis of ideas. Therefore,
intuition is not an organ of cognition and not an element of the scientific
method. All these arguments were clearly stated by Hegel in the preface to the
Phenomenology of Mind, opposing Schelling.</p><p>In the philosophy of the era of imperialism, intuition, on the contrary, is
given a central place within objective methodology. The need for this arises,
first of all, because thinkers reject the formalism of the theory of knowledge
of the past era. They should abandon it, since the very search for a certain
“worldview” already presupposes a meaningful posing of questions. However, the
subjective-idealistic doctrine of cognition, by virtue of necessity, is engaged
in a purely formal analysis of concepts, and not in their dialectical, mental
expression. If thinking crosses these boundaries and strives for philosophical
knowledge of the real content, then, on the one hand, it must rely on the
materialist theory of reflection and, on the other hand, on the dialectical
conceptual coherence of the world, and on such a coherence of the world which
is understood not only as a static relation between objectivities and
structures, but also as a dynamic relation in development (or in forward
motion) and thus in a reasonable history. For modern philosophy, intuition is a
tool that helps to abandon the formalism of the theory of knowledge and, at the
same time, from subjective idealism and (imaginary) agnosticism, without the
slightest shock of their foundations.</p><p>Such a philosophy will constantly encounter a contradiction, since the content
to which it seeks, and the worldview reality that it wants to achieve, is
regarded as impossible for expression in a concept and as a qualitatively
different, higher reality. In this regard, the simple fact of intuition gives
rise to an imaginary idea that it is, they say, a symbol of illumination and
understanding of this higher world. This gives rise to the problem of refuting
criticism from the side of conceptual analysis, which is vitally important for
the new philosophy. This ability for self-defense appears in intuition already
at the level of the aristocratic theory of knowledge in a similar form in
ancient philosophy (and even partly in ancient religious mysticism). This is
evidenced by the point of view, according to which not everyone is given an
intuitive comprehension of the highest reality. That is, the one who is looking
for conceptual criteria for intuitive understanding only confirms that he is
denied the gift of discretion of the highest reality. Such criticism is just
the exposure of its own inconsistency, just as in Andersen’s fairy tale, every
person was wrong if they did not see a beautiful new dress on the naked king.
Such a “theory of knowledge” is necessary for intuition, if only because, in
fact, any “reality” thus comprehended is arbitrary and uncontrollable.
Intuition as an organ of higher knowledge is at the same time a justification
for this arbitrariness.</p><p>So, we have approached the essence of the worldview of the era of imperialism.
Once again, we recall that for classical philosophy, the worldview was the
problem of scientific knowledge and was a scientific picture of the world; but
the transitional era rejected the scientific worldview and found insurmountable
difficulties where special scientific knowledge turned out to be insufficient
for understanding the phenomena. Imperialist philosophy continues to pile up
obstacles in the theory of knowledge and completes the process by creating a
super-scientific worldview hostile to science with the help of a new organ of
cognition, that is, with the help of intuition.</p><p>The main feature of the new worldview is the overthrow of the domination of
reason, its debunking. Romanticism, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard are the
predecessors of this trend, Dilthey marks the transition to a new era;
Nietzsche, Bergson, Spengler, Klages and, finally, existentialism appear as the
most important stages of this development. We repeat: the basis of the theory
of knowledge is invariably formed by agnosticism and the accompanying
relativism. If in the past epoch it was possible to be content with this
statement of the fundamental unknowability of reality, then the new philosophy
goes further than this; it begins to fight against rational thinking and
against reason. Simmel, in one of his works, examines the latest results of
modern science from the position of relativistic criticism and compares it with
the criticism with which the Enlightenment approached superstition, magic, etc.
Based on this, he considers it possible to conclude: We have good reason to
believe that the coming centuries will view the significant results of modern
science in the same way as we view superstition. Relativistic agnosticism and
doubt in everything, consistently carried to the end, open the way that leads
to the myth of the new world and to a world that is essentially hostile to
reason, or at least irrational, if not superintelligent. On the eve of World
War I, Bergson formulated this philosophy most emphatically. During the general
crisis after 1918, hostility towards reason is embodied in a concrete
philosophy of history, which, through Spengler, Klages and Heidegger, leads to
a diabolical, fascist vision of the world.</p><p>If we examine the specific content of this irrationality, then we will see its
close connection with the philosophical teachings of antiquity and see that it
only enriched the weak sides of bourgeois philosophy in general with timely
accents. This philosophy, which is not dialectical and therefore not truly
creative in the historical sense, generalizes the essence of reality, fanning
modernity to “eternal law” and “eternal existence.” At the time of the belief
in the eternity of capitalism, even before the eyes of historians inclined to
empiricism (Mommsen, Pelmann), the whole history was unfolding within
capitalist forms of life; the abstract ethics of Kantianism supported this
trend. In times of the crisis of imperialism, when everything is unstable,
everything is in disarray, when the bourgeois intelligentsia is forced to
observe, as the next day refutes what seemed indestructible today, it is faced
with a choice. It must admit either its own defeat or the defeat of reason. The
first path means recognizing your inability to comprehend reality in thought.
Here it would be the turn of reason, but it is from this rationality that
bourgeois thinking must withdraw. It is impossible to recognize this defeat
from a bourgeois standpoint, for that would mean a transition to the camp of
socialism. Therefore, at the crossroads, the bourgeois intelligentsia must
choose a different path; it must proclaim the collapse of reason. Of course,
this is possible in such a form in which philosophy allows reason to be
possible as the subjective side of the relationship to the real world, but as
the subjective side of such a connection, in which the subjective mind is
refuted every moment by reality (Scheler: powerlessness of reason; Benda,
Valery). However, this is not a general path, not the dominant direction of
crisis philosophy. For the leading bourgeois thinkers, reason does not exist at
all in reality; true reality, the highest reality, is irrational, hostile to
reason. Philosophy must recognize this fundamental fact of human life, and this
is how a new worldview of crisis philosophy arises – irrationalism.</p><p>This development is facilitated and accelerated by the fact that capitalism,
especially in its imperialist stage, unusually narrows the concrete space for
the realization of the individual in life. If we look at this question in the
abstract, there are two possibilities for reaction. It can understand the
relationship of this position with capitalist society and economy and draw
conclusions from it. Timid attempts at such activities are present at the
beginning of the era of imperialism, in places somewhere in Nietzsche’s
Romantic criticism of capitalist culture, in Simmel’s general criticism of
culture, in his theory of the “tragedy of culture.” But everywhere here the
mythologized, indirectly apologetic “third way” is being realized. In Nietzsche
it is like a mythical vision of a “new society.” With Simmel, it is like a
perfect inward-turning, the exclusive individual turning-in-oneself, moreover,
the external world, the soulless fetishization of capitalist society, directly
contributes to the problems of pure internal individualism. The soulless
“rationality” of the fetishized capitalist world thus becomes for Simmel a
launching pad for the individual’s transition to higher irrationality, to the
higher reality of pure individual inner being. Here the most important motive
of the irrationalist worldview is already appearing – the desire to mystify the
situation of people under imperialist capitalism as a “common human destiny.”
Parallel to this, there is a methodological division into two parts. Everything
that is natural from a social point of view, that corresponds to reason, is
now, according to this philosophy, hostile to the individual, inhuman. The
individual is inherently hostile to reason, irrational (this idea appears
already in the imperialist neo-Kantianism of Windelband and Rickert). To dress
up this concept in multi-colored myths and paint it – this is what fully
corresponds to the general need of the time, first of all, the “third way” in
social thought. Proceeding from the perspective of opposing the base inhuman
reason and the highest, human irrational reality, capitalism and socialism are
completely analogous, they even coincide; both are systems of the soulless
mind. In the name of individual irrational experiences, an ideological struggle
should be waged against both (the school of Stefan George, Klages). Fascism
adopts this method from head to toe, however, with some demagogic, roughening
additions (Romantic-reactionary criticism of liberalism combined with
anti-Semitic social demagogy!).</p><h2 id=vii-symptoms-of-the-crisis>VII. Symptoms of the crisis</h2><p>Let’s look at least a little at the methodology of irrationalism. Even Hegel
showed that if in formal thinking the necessary contradictions of reason are
revealed (it does not matter whether it is in the course of logical reasoning
or in a collision with reality), then the appearance of irrationality is the
direct form of the phenomenon of the problem. The task of dialectics is
precisely to show here a higher unity of opposites; and if ιτ succeeds, then it
turns out that it is precisely in the contradictions of reason, in bringing
them to the limit, in the appearance of irrationality, that hints of a higher
rationality are laid, that they contain an incentive to achieve a higher level,
a higher form of reason. But from the philosophy of imperialism, as we have
seen, the dialectical method was expelled from the very beginning.</p><p>We are faced with a similar problem in the science of knowledge, generated by
the capitalist division of labor, in connection with the attitude to certain
special sciences. Here they appear before us strictly and clearly separated
from each other. For each of them, reason, on the basis of its non-dialectical
categories, creates a special formal method. Therefore, the relations that in a
particular science can be considered in accordance with reason, as soon as they
appear in another science, begin to seem to have an irrational content,
indicating irrationalism is immutable. In order to give a typical example, I
will point to the philosophy of law of the famous neo-Kantian Kelsen. In his
struggle with the problem of legislation, that is, the emergence of the content
of law, – a problem which modern sociology, at the very least, but considered
as its own special problem – he concludes that the emergence of the content of
law is a “big secret” for the science of law. On the other hand, the formal
validity of law becomes exactly the same secret for bourgeois political
economy, etc.</p><p>As soon as the need for a common perception of the world, a world order arises
in society, “science of the spirit” and “history of the spirit” appear as
overcoming such scientific and theoretical difficulties. In contrast to the
preceding epoch and its epigones, a certain interconnection, totality is
sought, but, as clearly follows from what has been said above, on a false
basis. For a universal basis of individual sciences can be found only where it
is not sought: in a uniform, economically determined, socio-historical
development. It is clear that bourgeois thought cannot follow this path,
because it would require the revision of each separate science on the basis of
the dialectical-materialist method. The new era could not and did not want to
touch upon those fundamental contradictions that, due to the non-dialectical
nature of their method, faced specific sciences that arose on the basis of the
capitalist division of labor: after all, as we have seen, it has completely
adopted the subjective-idealist theory of knowledge, which creates the
philosophical basis of its methods.</p><p>Therefore, the synthesis carried out by the spiritual sciences can offer
something new only if it extols irrational relations as a myth. Since the time
of Dilthey’s “brilliant views,” intuition has everywhere become the dominant
method of synthesis in the sciences of the spirit. The result is that in the
course of intuitive comprehension, new fetishistic symbols appear, which are
inflated by a new renewed fetishization, a new mythologization to (true, purely
“individual,” irrational) images of reality. Although the history of the spirit
can also achieve certain specific historical results, but only when it departs
from its own method, when it turns to the real comprehension of society. (We
find separate studies of this kind already in Dilthey.)</p><p>The result is a vivid, in places spiritualized imaginary solution to all
philosophical problems. The “ingenious” arbitrariness of intuition is becoming
the generally accepted method of philosophy. Nietzsche still spoke about this
arbitrariness quite openly, later more and more attempts were made to disguise
it, to throw a veil of objectivity on it; in its most refined form, this occurs
where completely speculative phenomenology becomes the study of reality, the
science of reality, ontology (existentialism). The fact that here we are
talking about an imaginary solution is evident from the fact that, despite new
methods, despite radiant fantasies or dark, “deep,” logical and at the same
time antilogical philosophical and historical myths, all questions of
philosophy remain unresolved; even from the fact that philosophy lags far
behind in comparison with the results that were achieved in the classical
period.</p><p>A similar question is, first of all, the relationship between thinking and
reality, and in the closest connection with it – the problem of the internal
construction of logic itself. Irrationalism means a return to the old; it fixes
the opposition between reality and the categories of reason, that is, not yet
dialectical, based on the formal logic of thinking, as the last, irresistible
opposition. As we have seen, irrationalism means partly a philosophical
“justification” of arbitrarily created myths, partly that theoretical
philosophy gets stuck in formal logic again. The very claim of intuition to a
special aristocratic greatness, to an understanding of the “higher,”
inaccessible to an ordinary person, puts theoretical philosophy in the prison
of formal logic, which the philosophers of the classical period have already
destroyed.</p><p>Hence the problem of freedom and necessity arises. While classical philosophy
has significantly clarified its true position, since it concretized it (Hegel),
now again the abstract, absolute – and in this absoluteness has become
meaningless – concept of freedom opposes frozen and mechanical fatalism. This
is most clearly seen in Nietzsche, Spengler, and more recently in Sartre. The
so-called “worldview” of fascism is a caricature of this abstract, frozen, that
in its frozen abstraction has lost its meaning.</p><p>Fascism is in fact a caricature of the crisis of modern philosophy. But at the
same time, this caricature has long been a protracted, bloody reality. And an
important symptom of the crisis of bourgeois philosophy is the fact that the
so-called “worldview” of fascism originates from it, that it brought nothing
but demagogic coarsening and simplification of the ideas of imperialist
bourgeois philosophy, which Nietzsche began to develop. But this is precisely
why only dialectical materialism offered serious resistance to fascism in the
ideological struggle. Although the anti-fascist humanism of bourgeois
ideologists protested against certain manifestations of fascism and even
against the fact of its barbaric existence, it was never able to oppose to the
imaginary fascist worldview – to this irrationalist myth inflated into the
scale of a worldview – a new, truly progressive worldview. French
existentialism differs socially from the proto-fascist Heidegger in that its
first abstract “no” does not speak to the crisis reality in general, but to
fascism. However, this “no” is still completely abstract.</p><p>And this is no coincidence. After all, the overwhelming majority of
anti-fascist thinkers proceed in their worldview and method from the same
position from which the enemy proceeded. But if they nevertheless set
themselves the goal of proving that Schopenhauer and Nietzsche were humanists,
that their ideas are interpreted humanistically, then this new interpretation
will necessarily be helpless in comparison with fascism, which, albeit
vulgarly, developed the main tendencies in Schopenhauer’s and Nietzsche’s
ideas.</p><p>The crisis of bourgeois philosophy continues. A clear symptom of the crisis is
the fact that liberation from fascist intellectual terror did not lead to any
changes in bourgeois philosophy. Bourgeois philosophy (as opposed to advanced
literature) continued its path from where it left off before the advent of
fascism. From this point of view, the emergence of existentialism is also
indicative of a crisis. The problems of the new world are reflected today only
in dialectical materialism, only here they have clear, ideological outlines.
This is also no coincidence. Today, no one knows how long capitalism will be
able to hold out until socialism replaces it all over the world. However,
nothing indicates the ability of today’s bourgeoisie to build an independent,
comprehensive, progressive worldview.</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=/tags/lukacs>#lukacs</a>
