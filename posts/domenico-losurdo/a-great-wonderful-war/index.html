        <h1 id="the-gemeinschaft-and-the-socialism-of-war">The Gemeinschaft and the &ldquo;Socialism of War&rdquo;</h1>
<p>The outbreak of the First World War was perceived by more than just a few
European intellectuals as the confirmation of the irreversible crisis, not only
of historical materialism, but of every &ldquo;unilateral, natu- ralisric way of
thinking and feeling&rdquo; as well &mdash; the expression, we will see, is Husserl&rsquo;s. In
the presence of this conflict, considered by a large political press to be a
clash of opposed ideals and world visions, even as a reli- gious and holy war,
a <em>Glaubenskrieg</em>{^1}, the economic and material approach to the historical
world was revealing its bankruptcy. What point was there in continuing to speak
of class struggle when faced with a conflict that seemed to transcend every
material dimension? What were mere material interests when faced with a war
that seemed to demonstrate the supcrioriry of the spiritual over the
economical, and how relevant could those material interest be in the presence
of a national community wonderfully and intimately united in the hour of
danger?<br>
Such experiences more often than not stray into the mystical. Stefan
Zweig provides a very powerful description of the atmosphere in Vienna
immediately preceding the outbreak of the war:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As never before, thousands&mdash;hundreds of thousands&mdash;felt what they
should have felt in peacetime; that they belonged to a great nation &hellip;.  Each
one was called upon to cast his infinitesimal self into the glowing mass, and
there to be purified of all selfishness. All differences of class, religion and
language were washed away by the great feeling of fraternity&hellip;. Each
individual experienced an exaltation of his ego; he was no longer the isolated
person of former times; he felt incorporated into the mass, he was a part of
the people, and his person, his hitherto unnoticed person had been given
meaning.2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, we are still far from the atmosphere of Western or
European decline that will later emerge: Under the spell of the first days
or months of the war, what declined was every banausic or prosaic vision
of the world. Such visions were incapable of comprehending and
enjoying the extraordinary sensation of unity and spiritual fullfillment
experienced by the individual nations of the West as they engaged in
mortal combat with one another.</p>
<p>Even for Max Weber, who is, of course, far from the most rarefied or restless
spiritualism, there is no sense in trying to explain the war in terms of a
clash of opposed &ldquo;economic interests.&rdquo; Naturally, &ldquo;power interests&rdquo; are at
stake, but they are far from being reducible to the economic sphere, and
instead reveal a profound cultural and spiritual dimension. And anyway, at
least as far as Germany is concerned, she enters the war&mdash;even at the risk of
losing it&mdash;following the voice of &ldquo;destiny,&rdquo; to detend her &ldquo;honor.&ldquo;3 Meager
economic bookkeeping can perhaps explain the goals of the French, but &ldquo;anyone
among us with such an objective in war would not be German; <em>German existence,
not profit, is our goal in war.</em> &ldquo;4 More than ever, war becomes &ldquo;truly great
and wonderful beyond all expectations.&rdquo; <em>Groß und wunderbar</em>: it is an
expression that continuously recurs. Such is war, according to Weber,
regardless of its final outcome.5 In addition to Germany&rsquo;s power, other values
are at stake as well, higher ones. To understand them, it is worth quoting
Marianne Weber, who describes her husband&rsquo;s experience as the director of a
military hospital in the Heidelberg district. He was to assist and can: for
those who &ldquo;gave themselves without reserve to the Whole [<em>dem Ganzen</em>].&rdquo; And in
carrying out this task a harmonious, unprecedented unity is established:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In those marvelous first months all inner life was reduced to its simple,
shared outlines and everything unimportant crumbled away. Everyone was full of
goodwill and each day brought action and tension. Personal considerations were
suspended in the overpersonal [<em>Das Persönliche ist aufgehoben im
Überpersönlichen</em>]. It was the acme of existence [<em>Dasein</em>]6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is an extraordinary experience that involves the entire German nation,
molding it into a son of mystical collective body. The outbreak of the war
marks</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the hour of <em>depersonalization</em> [<em>Entselbstung</em>], and of integration into
the community [<em>gemeinsame Entrückung in das Ganze</em>]. An ardent love
of community [<em>Gemeinschaft</em>] spread among people, and they felt
bound by flesh and blood to one another. Having formed a brother hood, they were ready to destroy their individual identities through
their service.7</p>
</blockquote>
