We on the democratic left are living through a real crisis. And precisely because I believe the Socialist Party has a very vital role to play in this period, I would like to say something about the problems we confront.
One aspect is that many people on the [so-called democratic] left today substitute psychology for politics.</description></item><item><title>Introduction: Restoration in Russia by Boris Kagarlitsky</title><link>https://classletters.org/posts/assorted/restoration-in-russia/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2023 02:35:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://classletters.org/posts/assorted/restoration-in-russia/</guid><description>This brief writing belongs to the Introduction to Boris Kagarlitsky&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;ldquo;Restoration in Russia: Why Capitalism Failed&amp;rdquo;. The work is both a valuable reflection of, and look into, the tumultuous years following the dissolution of the USSR.
&amp;lsquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t hammer in a bolt.&amp;rsquo; This was among the slogans used by the pro-government political bloc Russia&amp;rsquo;s Choice in its campaign for the parliamentary elections of December 1993. Spokespeople for the bloc explained to voters: it&amp;rsquo;s pointless to dream of a just society, so you have to reconcile yourself to the new order.</description></item><item><title>Global Neoliberal Practice: Institutions and Regulation in Africa by Graham Harrison</title><link>https://classletters.org/posts/assorted/neoliberal-africa-global-practice/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 22:51:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://classletters.org/posts/assorted/neoliberal-africa-global-practice/</guid><description>This is a chapter out of Graham Harrison&amp;rsquo;s Book &amp;ldquo;Neoliberal Africa: The Impact of Global Social Engineering&amp;rdquo;. Although the book is more of an essay containing fragmentary thoughts, I found this chapter substantial in the sense that it clearly outlined the various institutional avenues in which projects such as neoliberalism cement their ideology.
This chapter considers the global emergence of neoliberalism. It looks at the ways in which neoliberal practice has emerged, expanded and established for itself ‘paradigmatic’ status.</description></item><item><title>Race into Culture: A Critical Genealogy of Cultural Identity by Walter Benn Michaels</title><link>https://classletters.org/posts/walter-benn-michaels/geneology-race-into-culture/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 10:59:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://classletters.org/posts/walter-benn-michaels/geneology-race-into-culture/</guid><description>Due to the prolific number of footnotes that Michael&amp;rsquo;s article contains, the essay will simply be linked to here. It is an important walk through the trajectories that various essentialist concepts have taken in the course of modern Northern American history. What surprised me most was this quasi-progess &amp;mdash; where it appears that the concept of race has been disposed of, it&amp;rsquo;s kernel is carried over into a different, yet sadly, familial form.</description></item><item><title>Soviet Literature by Maxim Gorky</title><link>https://classletters.org/posts/maxim-gorky/soviet-literature/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 08:06:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://classletters.org/posts/maxim-gorky/soviet-literature/</guid><description>Herein is a speech delivered in August 1934, and published in 1935. It reappeared in Gorky, Radek, Bukharin, Zhdanov and others “Soviet Writers’ Congress 1934,” page 25-69, Lawrence &amp;amp; Wishart, 1977, and was transcribed by Jose Braz for the Marxists Internet Archive.
The role of the labour processes, which have converted a two-Legged animal into man and created the basic elements of culture, has never been investigated as deeply and thoroughly as it deserves.</description></item><item><title>The Crisis of Bourgeois Philosophy by György Lukács</title><link>https://classletters.org/posts/lukacs/crisis-of-bourgeois-philosophy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Mar 2023 01:59:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://classletters.org/posts/lukacs/crisis-of-bourgeois-philosophy/</guid><description>Written in 1948.
The fact of the crisis has been stated not only by us Marxists. The concept of “crisis” has long taken root in bourgeois philosophy. When, for example, Siegfried Marck, a famous neo-Hegelian, wanted to define Rickert’s place in the development of philosophy, he called him a thinker of the “pre-crisis era.” Indeed, if we carefully trace the development of bourgeois philosophy in recent decades, we will see that literally every two years the foundations of philosophy are again and again called into question.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Class Notes by Adolph Reed Jr.</title><link>https://classletters.org/posts/adolph-reed-jr/intro-to-class-notes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2023 02:15:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://classletters.org/posts/adolph-reed-jr/intro-to-class-notes/</guid><description>The text here is an extract from Adolph Reed Jr&amp;rsquo;s 2000 work &amp;ldquo;Class Notes&amp;rdquo;. This publication is the founding inspiration for the theme and title of this site here &amp;ndash; long live Reed.
This book is built on commentary about current issues and events in american politics over most of the 1990s. as such, it expresses an on-going attempt to make sense of contemporary american political life from a critical perspective.</description></item></channel></rss>
