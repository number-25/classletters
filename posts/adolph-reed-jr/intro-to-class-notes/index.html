This publication is the founding inspiration for the theme and title of this site here &ndash; long live Reed.</em></p><p>This book is built on commentary about current issues and events in american
politics over most of the 1990s. as such, it expresses an on-going attempt to
make sense of contemporary american political life from a critical perspective.
most of the essays published here appeared originally in substantially the same
form in my regular columns in the progressive and the village voice, or in
similar venues. writing in those venues presents a special challenge— to convey
complex, perhaps unconventional ideas clearly and concisely to a general
audience. i’ve found this challenge very useful partly because i work out my
own views on many issues by writing about them; to that extent, these essays
are much less a set of didactic pronoucements than a sustained attempt to think
things through, and the obligation to communicate those views effectively to
others encourages preciseness and clarity. having to ask constantly, “what
would this formulation mean to someone outside my own head or outside a
narrowly specialized community of discourse?” imposes a requirement to bring
abstractions down to the ground, to imagine how— if at all— they appear in,
explain or bear upon the daily world we inhabit and reproduce. the challenge
is more important, though, as a corrective to the flight from concreteness that
has increasingly beset left theorizing and social criticism, and as a result
political practice, in the u.s. in recent decades.</p><p>This flight has taken at least two distinct forms, both fueled by the decline
of popular activism after the 1960s. One route led directly from activists’
deepening isolation in the 1970s and was driven by a failure to adapt to the
new political situation. The other was charted by university-based leftists’
accommodations to their environment during the 1970s and 1980s. These
tendencies, of course, were not the 1960s’ only radical legacy. Many activists
dug in and persisted in the labor movement and other terrains of organizing,
advocacy, and constituency-based politics, adapting to political realities and
the requirements of building a real base for action while not losing sight of
larger principles and goals. More than a few did so after or through periods of
sectarian affiliation, often drawing usefully on the discipline learned in such
political organizations while discarding the immobilizing sectarian baggage.
One of the most encouraging aspects of the current period is that a good many
of those people have become solid, wellrooted leaders in trade unions and other
popularly grounded political institutions.</p><p>It is no accident that this legacy of 1960s radicalism goes largely unnoticed
in public discussion around the state of the left. Even in what passes for a
left public sphere there is little sense of creating a movement as an activity
that rests on organizing, working actually to build support and solidarity
among real people in real places around concrete objectives that they perceive
as concerns— people who may not, indeed probably do not, all start from
commitment to what is generally understood as a left political perspective or
identification with issues that leftists see as highly symbolic. Instead, the
more gestural approaches to politics associated with the flight from
concreteness have been much more prominent and visible, and tend to monopolize
public discourse about the left. That results mainly, I suspect, from the
circumstance that the left public sphere itself is sharply slanted toward the
social world and sensibilities of disconnected left intellectuals and political
celebrities and, to that extent, reflects the symbiosis of defeatist thinking
and wish fulfillment that have come to shape political thinking in such
quarters. This book proceeds from a different view, one neatly summarized in
the Labor Party’s model of an “ organizing approach to politics.” From this
perspective, the key fact is that we do not have the popularly based,
institutionalized, mass political movement that we need to realize any
meaningful progressive agenda in the United States. Therefore, the principal
task should be building an active membership base for such a movement.
Strategic political thinking and critique should be harnessed to that goal as
the normative and pragmatic linchpin of analysis. Finally, the movement we need
cannot be convoked magically overnight or by proxy. It cannot be galvanized
through proclamations, press conferences, symbolic big events, resolutions or
quixotic electoral candidacies; it can be built only through connecting with
large numbers of people in cities and towns and workplaces all over the country
who can be brought together around a political agenda that speaks directly and
clearly to their needs and aspirations as they perceive them. This, like all
organizing, is a painstaking, slow and time-consuming process, and it promises
no guarentees of ultimate victory or even shorter-term success. But there are
no alternatives other than fraud, pretense or certain failure.</p><p>This viewpoint has always seemed to me to be simple common sense. The twists
and turns of the self-identified left, both activist and intellectual
varieties, from the Carter years through Clinton— including more than a decade
of responding to the Reaganite onslaught by focusing on international
solidarity work and serving as prop soldiers in Jesse Jackson’s Potemkin army,
never admitting what his game so clearly is— underscore just how great a toll
the legacy of defeat has taken on strategic will and clarity within our ranks.
For that reason, I think it is helpful to reconstruct the two main roads that
led to this situation.</p><p>One strain of those activists who found themselves cut off from ready access to
any broader audience or dialogue were left talking to no one but one another.
Their isolation was reinforced by a largely honorable rejection of pressures to
abjure radicalism. Practical expressions of that rejection, however, were often
naively catechistic and misguided strategically. Radicalism’s proceeding
marginalization heightened fears that attempts to compensate would slide into
an opportunistic betrayal of fundamental radical commitments. Those fears set
in motion a dynamic of intensifying ideological vigilance and purification. As
a consequence, many who took that route succumbed to the temptation to retreat
into arcane debates, ever further removed from issues and concerns that
resonate with the lives of people outside the self-conscious left. They
produced a pattern of left discourse that centers on fitting aspects of
contemporary social relations into one or another pre-scripted narrative of
global revolution or noble resistance. Thus a current of activist radicalism
dribbled off into scholastic, albeit bizarrely intense (and often intensely
bizarre), debates over what “ stage” of capitalism or imperialism the current
moment represented, to what extent which populations in the United States or
elsewhere enacted generic roles assigned to them in a given potted narrative,
or which mundane political actions or events indicated impending revolutionary
ferment or proper revolutionary consciousness. The more isolated this
radicalism became, the more insular and idiosyncratic became its language and
critiques. The more it was removed from connection to palpable constituencies
or membership outside the ranks of the already faithful, the less constrained
it was by pragmatic or strategic thinking. The more solipsistic it became, the
less capable it was of distnguishing matters of principle, strategy and
tactics, and the less dependent theoretical arguments were on any test of
practical efficacy. And throughout this spiral a flamboyant and self-righteous
rhetoric combined with interpretations of current events and popular behavior—
without regard to the expressed understandings and objectives of those who
enact such events and behaviors— as proxy evidence for radicals’ pet theories,
a combination that has worked to paper over the reality of marginalization.</p><p>Characterizing a rent strike, say, or a group of neighbors’ challenge to an
eviction as, in effect, a rejection of capitalist imperatives in the provision
of housing, or representing a protest against an instance of police brutality
as the equivalent of a demand for selfdetermination camouflages radicals’
inability to win adherents for their programs. Such representations accommodate
marginalization through a form of denial. Redefining such political expressions
as deeply, intrinsically, substantively, or implicitly radical enables a
sleight-of-hand that imputes support for the radicals’ broader programs by
association, without the test of persuasion. This is what underlies sectarian
newspapers’ penchant for running photographs of members displaying signs with
radical slogans at union picket lines or other sorts of more broadly based
demonstrations and rallies. Moreover, because this politics is propelled by
illusion and a Humpty Dumpty-like use of language, it can wildly inflate the
meaning of the most modest or conventional actions or events without
reservation. It also has built-in mechanisms for avoiding critical
self-reflection on practice and acknowledgement of failure. I recall from my
graduate school years a particularly outrageous illustration of the lengths to
which this kind of reasoning can go to invert reality.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of Pinochet’s brutal coup against Salvador Allende’s
government in Chile, a colleague of mine pronounced the coup “progressive”
because it had taught the Chilean left the futility of the electoral option. T
o the objections that the left was being liquidated even as he spoke, he
responded that it was possible to “kill the individuals but not the tendency.”
Substituting fanciful taxonomy for strategic analysis and assessment (for
example, portraying the Million Man March as a general strike) also made it
possible to tag along with whatever motion appears to have some visibility or
popular support. Worse, precisely because its operative logic (“ has a similar
effect as = might as well be = is” ) generates protean capacities for
projecting its illusions onto the behavior of others, this politics can
rationalize quite disreputable and opportunistic associations, simply by
defining them formalistically as something loftier. After all, anything can
mean anything if you get to stipulate the conditions of meaning without
constraint by the mundane facts of an external world, such as the perceptions
and objectives of others. In recent years one of the clearest instances of this
tendency on the national stage has been so many leftists’ persistence in
tailing after Jesse Jackson’s political charade and minimizing or justifying
his dubious, often obviously and crudely self-serving, programmatic twists and
turns. For many this commitment has extended even to accepting the preposterous
formula that defines the character of media and official attention to Jackson’s
person— the rhetoric, resonant with the presumptions of an absolutist
Sovereign, centered on whether he has been treated with “ respect” — as
identical with recognition of progressive interests. In some cases, to be sure,
this will to believe stems from political romanticism and naivete, racial
patriotism or guilty racial liberalism. In many others, however, it rests on
doomed hope that association with Jackson will confer popular legitimacy or
otherwise provide access to a popular constituency. That association and the
desperate hope undergirding it are poignant evidence of the legacy of defeat.
A second form of the left’s flight from concreteness is distinct from, but grew
organically within the defeatist environment prepared by, the first. The
notions of cultural politics that acquired currency over the 1980s and 1990s
developed most immediately in university circles. Intellectually, this
tendency’s proximate sources derived from the structuralist and
poststructuralist turns in left academic discourse that had become increasingly
prominent during the 1970s and 1980s. This strain as well originated from
entirely reasonable, even politically laudable concerns. Leftist scholars,
particularly in the social sciences and humanties, who entered the professoriat
from the activism of the 1960s were generally concerned to find ways to
harmonize their intellectual and political interests and to secure a place for
left perspectives in mainstream academic discourses.</p><p>Structuralist Marxism, a 1970s theoretical import either directly from France
or via the British, New Left Review, appealed to those concerns. In emphasizing
the causal significance of durable social forces in shaping social systems and
constraining behavior, structuralism provided a common conceptual frame of
reference for radical and nonradical— or Marxist and non-Marxist— scholars
interested in examining the ways that societies change or remain stable. This
common frame of reference promised to open lines of communication between
radical and nonradical tendencies and thereby to soften the ideological and
institutional barriers that marginalized radical critiques within conventional
academic disciplines. The greater legitimacy came at a price that became both
less noticeable and more consequential as extramural activism receded toward
the vanishing point in the historical rearview mirror. Pursuit of
respectability in mainstream academic disciplines required shelving the idea of
class struggle as an orienting principle of inquiry and debate. Pressures to do
so came from several sources. Maintaining a community of discourse with
nonradicals meant suspending premises the latter found unacceptable.
Contemporary academic norms regard obvious political engagement— that is,
linking inquiry to unconventional or controversial political programs and
interpretations— as inconsistent with scholarly distance and integrity. Those
norms operate at the individual level as career imperatives as well. And the
atrophy o f radical activism outside the university fed this process by eroding
possibilities for anchoring left scholarly activity in strategic dialogue with
coherent political movements.</p><p>Structuralism’s departure from the vantage point o f class struggle supported a
tendency to understate the space for meaningful human intervention in politics.
The result was a form of theoretical narrative emphasizing the power of
entrenched patterns of relations and institutions and discounting the
possibilities for systemic change. A structuralist perspective is biased toward
predicting continuities; structural forces move inertially. However, political
interventions that can disrupt that inertia are volatile and usually
unpredictable. T o the extent that structuralist Marxism lost its moorings in
the commitment to grounding inquiry and interpretation in the objective of
strategic intervention in class struggle— or any other program of
transformative practical action— this turn produced a radical scholarship that
more than mirrored the decline of the left outside the university; it also
often rationalized that decline and sanctified it in the language of scientific
law.</p><p>A curious parallel to ultraleft sectarianism developed in academic life: a
logic of radical one-upmanship in which the winning arguments were those that
purportedly demonstrated that capitalist or ruling class power was so great
that any specific action attempting to challenge it was destined to fail. Like
left sectarianism, the discourse of structuralist Marxism failed to see the
processual, dialectical character of political action, its contingent
open-endedness. Much as left sectarians are immobilized by their conviction
that it is not possible to change anything until everything is changed, the
vantage point of structuralist Marxism similarly immobilizes by its tendency to
view the configuration of power relations existing at a given moment as
identical to the limits of possibility. They equally fail to recognize that
putting the ball in play can suddenly change the alignment of forces in the
field and create openings that could not have been predicted. Both forget, that
is, what Marx recognized more than a century and a half ago: that, although
constrained by structures (which in turn are not active, insuperable things,
but the congealed effect of “ circumstances directly encountered, given and
transmitted from the past” ), the course of history is dynamic and open-ended,
that people actually do make history, even if not “just as they please, under
circumstances chosen by themselves.” Sectarians respond to their immobilization
with apocalyptic rhetoric, opportunism and wish-fulfillment;
structuralist-Marxist academics tend to respond with melancholy and an almost
sentimental pessimism— the highly theorized retreat to a world-weary, sometimes
agonizedly disappointed quietism that presumes the privilege of secure, middle
to upper-middle class employment with good benefits.</p><p>In the early 1980s left academic theorizing took a turn at least suggestive of
explicit political engagement. Originating primarily in the humanities, a
self-consciously radical scholarly discourse formed around the interpretive
programs and intellectual sensibility represented by such labels as
poststructuralism, deconstruction and postmodernism. This sensibility converged
on reaction against large-scale social theories of any kind and rejection of
any form of centralizing power or notion of objective truth. As a politics,
this translates into: 1) a focus on the supposedly liberatory significance of
communities and practices defined by their marginality in relation to systems
of entrenched power or institutions, 2) a preference for strategies of “
resistance” to imperatives of institutions and “ transgression” of conventions
rather than strategies aimed at transformation of institutions and social
relations, and 3) a conviction that the basic units of a radical politics
should be groups formed around ascriptive identities that relate to one another
on a principle of recognizing and preserving the integrity of their various
differences.</p><p>This politics has a dual institutional foundation in academic life.
Theoretically, it emerged from the turn in literary studies to linguistic
analysis that sought to destabilize conventional understandings of the relation
between signifiers and signified, text and world. It also no doubt seemed
attractive to some left-inclined scholars and students who wanted to overcome
structuralism’s denial of possibilities for transformative political action.
Sociologically, it struck a responsive chord in those academic networks
concerned with advancing the status of women, blacks and other minorities as
students, faculty, and subject matter, particularly at elite colleges and
universities. The new academic radicalism appealed to faculty and students
struggling, against an often bigoted skepticism and orthodoxy, to establish
footholds of institutional legitimacy for women’s studies, black studies, and
other specialty areas associated with the democratization and expanded purview
of American academic life since the 1960s. Its immersion in Continental
European philosophy and rarefied critical theory give it a high intellectuality
that legitimizes studies of “ marginal discourses” in conventionally
professionalistic academic terms— by vesting them with the raiments of
technical sophistication and the authority of a canon of Greats. Because it is
formulated at high levels of theoretical abstraction, the postmodernist /
poststructuralist sensibility is broadly gauged enough to provide a common
critical frame of reference for practitioners and advocates of the various
marginal discourses and, indeed, has been partly responsible for constituting
them as such a group. In that sense, as a practical academic politics this
radicalism has functioned in ironic contrast to its theoretical commitments to
“ decentering” and suspicion of “ totalizing” projects; it has operated rather
more like a language of nation-building or, at a minimum, interest-group
aggregation. The various specialty areas still compete with one another for
resources and visibility, and the status of postmodernism and poststructuralism
within each is contested, sometimes sharply, as in African American studies.
However, an apparatus of journals, colloquia, anthologies, and conferences has
helped to create a community of discourse and institutional networks that unite
adherents across fields. The emergence of “ cultural studies” as a rubric is an
expression, and an instrument, of that process.</p><p>The new sensibility’s critique of the conventional disciplines’ ideological
partiality and arbitrary exclusivism in their focal preoccupations was an
obvious source of its attractiveness in those insurgent academic precincts that
would come together affirmatively around the rhetoric of cultural studies,
multiculturalism, or diversity, and that have shared the frustrating condition
of being ignored or assigned inferior status in disciplines, departments, and
budgets. In taking “ difference,” marginality, and fragmentation as guiding
theoretical principles and in orienting inquiry around specification of an
expanding mulitiplicity of “voices” and discrete group per spectives, the
postmodernist / poststructuralist sensibility is congenial to arguments for
enhancing the institutional and intellectual status of those new fields and
practitioners within them. Formulations such as “ standpoint theory” recast
the insight that perception is shaped by social position— articulated by Marx
and a long-available, uncontroversial first premise of the sociology of
knowledge— and elevate it into a major interpretive departure and a theory of
knowledge and research program in its own right. Asserting the primary
importance of “ positionality” in shaping perception and grounding knowledge
has two programmatic implications that buttress the institutional programs of
the new fields. First, in establishing a rationale for reading coherent group
perspective unproblematically from common identity, that assertion solidifies
field boundaries by giving them an elaborate theoretical foundation. If group
identity is a fundamental ingredient of perception, then organizing academic
programs and discourses around identity-group studies is all the more
appropriate. Second, its premise that a shared identity confers a special
interpretive authority reinforces, more or less subtly, a proprietary advantage
for practitioners and interpretations able to claim that authority. As a guild
move, this arguably mitigates the ethnocentric bias that partly defines
mainstream lines of academic prestige, status, and interpretive priority
dominated by white, heterosexual men. It does so, however, at the price of at
least opening the door to the proposition that being classified as an X by
definition gives one special insight to interpreting the X, a proposition that
is indefensible and potentially poisonous both intellectually and politically.</p><p>The hefty theoretical apparatus obscures the fact that those claims, and the
larger arguments elevating positionality, rest on badly flawed, at least
implicitly essentialist views about group consciousness. Formulations such as “
the experience or perspective of the X ” depend logically on presumption of a
universal, consensual or somehow otherwise singularly definitive and authentic
state of X-ness. The abstract and hermetic language of positionality,
difference, and otherness fixes the interpretive lens at a point so remote from
the ways that people live their lives and form themselves in the everyday world
we all share— the world of seeking, working, or worrying about a job, finding
and consuming healthcare, forming and maintaining personal attachments, paying
bills, raising children, playing, fretting about the future, shopping for
furniture, trying to make sense of current events— that it never confronts very
mundane questions that expose the inadequacy of essentializing notions of
identity. How is it plausible to project such singular perspectives as “ the
standpoint of the X ” onto populations consisting of individuals whose lives
and social positions are not reducible to a single category, whose individual
histories of experience differ enormously and whose points of view and
interests are likely to be shaped in complex and idiosyncratic ways? O f the
multiple identities that can be gleaned from the life of a given individual—
student, worker, parent, manager, child, stamp collector, fantasy baseball
enthusiast, precinct captain, deacon, veteran, homeowner, landlord, nurse,
developer, teacher, electrician— why should we assume that perspective is
endowed fundamentally by race, gender, or sexual orientation?</p><p>A common response to the last question is that those identities stand out
because they are the ones through which populations in this society are marked
for marginalization. True enough, but those are not the only categories of
people marginalized in the society; the more than forty-three million with no
healthcare access, the hundreds of thousands of permanently displaced
steelworkers and mineworkers, the millions of homeless and near homeless
people, the so called urban underclass, residents of low-income public housing,
low-wage workers in sweatshops and the consumer service sector are among the
most obvious. Those categories crosscut race, gender, and sexual orientation,
and for individuals many of them overlap. Nonwhites and women are
disproportionately present within nearly all of them, but they are not
reducible to race or gender. And it is by no means a foregone conclusion that,
say, a displaced black steelworker, who is a single parent working an insecure,
low-wage job with no benefits and trying to negotiate the metropolitan crisis
in affordable housing, will experience her daily life and social position,
fashion her dreams and expectations, or interpret her concerns and grievances
primarily or typically through perceptions of racial or gender identity over
the other categories­that reflect pertinent facets of her practical life. That
response also does not clearly enough distinguish a claim of moral obligation
(that we should privilege race, gender, and sexual orientation because those
are the terms under which people are sorted hierarchically and oppressed) and
an empirical one (that we should privilege those categories because they are
the ones through which— perhaps because of their centrality in the system of
social hierarchy— people primarily understand themselves). Attempts within
postmodernist sensibility to account for the multiplicity and variety of
individuals’ identities center on the notion of “ hybridity,” the blending or
mixture of identities to form new ones. However, this notion emerges from a
discourse centered on specifying “ difference” ; unsurprisingly, therefore, its
accommodation is formalistic and reified. Hybridity, much like scientific
racialist notions of dual consciousness and atavism in the Victorian era,
presumes the merger or pastiche of distinct identities, a curiously mechanistic
view of how human beings are formed and form themselves. Such constructions as
“ the subject position of the black gay male,” as presumably distinguishable
from the white gay male, black straight male, etc., do not overcome the problem
of essentializing views of identity. They only compound it by extending the
logic of fragmentation to break down larger essentialisms into congeries of
smaller ones, mapping ever more precise combinations of identity positions.</p><p>The fetish of precision in specifying identities relates ironically both to
this intellectual movement’s general critical project and its self-image of
cultural radicalism. Although the impulse probably stems most immediately from
theoretical and moral or ideological concern with acknowledging marginalization
or unrepresented “voices,” the attempt to follow through on this concern
assumes an unproblematic ability to map and detail the bases of human action
that is reminiscent of the most naive positivist faith in the possibility of
scientific certainty. This assumption can be sustained only by arbitrarily
limiting the universe of pertinent identities to the handful of privileged “
standpoints.” This idealist pretense, though, is subject to pressure,
consistent with the natural logic of the discourse of difference, further to
elaborate the universe of privileged identities. We might, therefore, imagine
an effort to define the subject position of the black, heterosexual, single
mother, displaced steelworker, low-wage worker with inadequate healthcare and
poor access to affordable housing. That is doubtful, however, and not least
because undertaking the effort would demonstrate the folly of the entire
enterprise. There is, after all, no such single subject position, not even in
the life of a given individual who might occupy all the categories. And even if
there were such a least common denominator position, it would hardly be
accessible through a method of adding up reified notions of a bunch of discrete
“ identities.”</p><p>Despite its affective packaging, the disposition to catalogue and aggregate
neatly rounded-off identities is in no meaningful way radical. Not only is it
evocative of nineteenth-century essentialisms, it also reproduces the mindset
of the mass information industry, which, through public opinion and market
research, sorts the population into the demographic equivalent of sound bites —
market shares, taste communities— all in service to the corporate sales effort
and management of the national political agenda. Within progressive politics,
this mode of argument has precedents in the allegations of black workers’
double oppression that appeared in some quarters of left debate in the 1970s
and of black women’s double or triple oppression that gained currency within
the women’s movement perhaps a bit later. Implicit in both formulations was a
presumption that greater oppression assigned a group greater insight or gave
its claims moral priority. T o the extent that the proliferating specification
of identity positions follows a similar logic it betrays the grain of truth
beneath conservatives’ ugly dismissals of the new academic specialties as “
oppression studies.” The right-wing smear aims to discredit successes in
broadening the composition of faculties and student bodies and to reinstate the
narrow, sanitized, and parochial orthodoxies that had been hegemonic in the
social sciences and humanities. However, it is a sinisterly motivated
exaggeration of a nonetheless real tendency to invoke language that inflates
the political and moral urgency of what are ultimately insular academic
debates.</p><p>Any intellectual movement that develops a following will do so because it gains
institutional and ideological, as well as theoretical, traction. The new
academic radicalism, whatever its other attributes, meshes well with a sort of
interest-group politics that has developed out of the democratization of
university culture during the 1970s and 1980s. This development has accompanied
and helped to solidify a marked improvement over the parochialism that
previously defined much of academic life. Its accomplishments, though, can be
limited and distorted by succumbing to its own ideological mystifications just
as the narrow, self-centered pufferies of a generation ago passed for universal
truth. For example, the idea that the social world in general can be read as
one would literary texts is a staple of the poststructuralist / postmodernist
sensibility. This idea has made a very useful intellectual contribution. In
particular, it has been important in focusing critical attention on the extent
to which accounts of natural and social events and phenomena are narratives and
display properties common that form, which means, among other things, that they
are strategically organized and not pure or passive expressions of those
phenomena.</p><p>The insight that the world can be read as a text, however, easily slides into
the reverse— a claim that interpreting literary texts is identical with
interpreting the wider world. This reversal is an attractive fiction partly
because it invests studies of literary and other forms of cultural production
with an aura of political importance they would not otherwise possess. It is
understandable that scholars who generally see themselves as committed to
progressive or activist interests would be inclined to locate and emphasize
political significance in their work. However, the leap that equates, for
instance, the practices of textual interpretation or the production and
analysis of forms of popular culture with direct challenges to power relations—
such as conducting a strike, electing or defeating a legislator, mobilizing
against N AFTA, fighting against segregation or for national healthcare— takes
that inclination to the point of solipsism. And it empties the idea of
political action of any substantive meaning.</p><p>Assertions of political significance also add rhetorical force in the struggle
for position and competition for resources in institutional politics. Equating
the particularistic objectives of an academic program and a global struggle
against injustice rehearses a common ploy in liberal discourse, one that
originates in the dramaturgy of War on Poverty and Great Society politics in
the 1960s. It is a standard move in the interest-group negotiation that is the
default mode of American liberal politics.</p><p>This compatibility with interest-group pluralism may be a cornerstone of the
material and ideological foundation of the postmodern / poststructuralist
sensibility’s cachet as a style of political expression. The interest-group
model depends on a form of elite brokerage, centered on a relation between
governing elites and entities or individuals recognized as representatives of
designated groups. The heart of the relation is negotiation of policies,
programs, and patterns of distribution of resources that presumably protect and
advance the interests of the pertinent groups, but safely— in ways that
harmonize them with the governing elite’s priorities. What we now understand as
identity politics emerged as a rhetorical and programmatic vehicle for
incorporating an appropriate notion of black interests into this arrangement,
in response to popular mobilizations associated with civil rights and black
power activism. Feminist, other nonwhite minority group, and gay interests
subsequently have been incorporated on the same model. The new academic
radicalism has attained currency partly because it ratifies what already
exists; beneath all the theoretical pyrotechnics, it both packages the world in
familiar ways and reinforces prevailing conceptual and organizational
arrangements of liberal politics— both inside the university and as it looks at
the society in general. More specifically, the style of pluralist identity
politics it endorses and enacts assigns a privileged place to academic
interpreters of the interests and perspectives— the “positionality” — of the
designated identity groups. The essentialist underpinnings of these notions of
group identity define away the contradiction of a scholarly and political
discourse that purports to articulate perceptions and intentions of populations
without evidence of the latter’s explicit participation in communicating those
perceptions and intentions. This is what the “politics of recognition” that
arises from the postmodernist / poststructuralist sensibility boils down to— a
call to accept the authority of cultural theorists as articulators of the
voices of populations who are presumed by the theory to be incapable of
speaking clearly for themselves in public, explicit ways. This is the rational
core within the absurd nattering about whether the “ subaltern” can speak. It
also underlies the popularity of the notion of “ cultural politics,” which I
discuss at length in the first two essays in Part Three. Its basic premise is
that the authentic forms of political expression among marginalized groups are
not made directly or through regular, institutional channels of political
action. Their authentic expressions are instead surreptitious or indirect— in
“hidden transcripts,” covert acts of “ resistance,” and “ resistive” cultural
practices (for example, dancing, hanging out in the club scene, wearing
unconventional fashion). This argument, requires disregarding much dramatically
courageous, acutely articulate and self-conscious activity as at least
implicitly inauthentic, and it ultimately renders those populations mute and
reinforces the intermediary role of the academic interpreters.</p><p>From this vantage point, recent debates that juxtapose identity politics or
cultural politics to class politics are miscast. Cultural politics and identity
politics are class politics. They are manifestations within the political
economy of academic life and the leftliberal public sphere—journals and
magazines, philanthropic foundations, the world of “public intellectuals” — of
the petit bourgeois, brokerage politics of interest-group pluralism.
Postmodernist and poststructuralist theorizing lays a radical-sounding patina
over this all-too-familiar worldview and practice. As it moves beyond the
academic arena, the limitations of this approach to politics become all the
more striking. Insofar as identity politics insists on recognizing difference
as the central truth of political life, it undercuts establishing a broad base
as a goal of organizing. Its reflex is to define ever more distinct voices and
to approach collective action from an attitude more like suspicion than
solidarity. Not unlike left sectarianism, its tendency is to demand that a
movement be born fully formed, that all its participants possess an evenly
developed, comprehensive progressive critique from the outset. This stance
typically requires demonstrating knowledge of and appropriate gestures of
respect for the differences and “perspectives” of a broad range of potential
participants as prerequisite to acting in concert; this is how the “politics of
recognition” takes shape as a practice. Whites must demonstrate their
antiracism; heterosexuals must prove their opposition to homophobia; men must
establish their antisexism; each nonwhite group must convincingly show its
appreciation and respect for the perspectives of the others— all before
strategic consideration of possible points of mutual concern. Also as with
sectarianism, managing the internal politics of the movement comes easily to
take precedence over externally focused action.</p><p>Anyone with experience in left-of-center activist politics in the last thirty
years has been exposed to the dynamic. The standards of proof vary, not only
with the specific context, but also with the mood, personal and political
idiosyncrasies, and sincerity of the participants. Because there is no such
thing as “ the perspective of the X ” apart from the pronouncements of those
who claim privileged access to it, no one can ever be fully certain not to be
committing disrespect. (Just as in mainstream interest-group politics, the
ironic truth underlying this style is that it requires the good will of those
who are presumed to be insensitive; otherwise, they would feel no guilt or
concern to prove themselves.) In such conditions, opportunists or wackos can
deploy the language of distrust with the destructive effect of provocateurs.</p><p>Because identity politics does not grow from a coherent vision of
how the society should work, it cannot build broad unity around a
coherent common program. Instead, its model of movementbuilding revolves around constructing and imposing formal images
of representativeness. This approach reduces political criticism to
scrutinizing the official composition of a movement to ascertain
which “voices” are present in what proportions and with what
prominence, and which are not. The tendency, therefore, is to subordinate consideration of a movement’s or organization’s program,
goals, and strategies to the appearance of its freeze-frame photo. A
standard form of intervention from the mindset of identity politics
illustrates this limitation.</p><p>A predictable moment in progressive meetings of virtually any sort, even at
incipient stages o f an organizing effort, is when someone— more or less
piously, more or less smugly, always selfrighteously— rises to introduce the
concern that, “As I look around the room, I don’t see enough of the X, the Y or
the Z present” and to issue the standard calls for inclusiveness and for making
greater effort to reach out, etc. This intervention has a pro forma, gestural
quality. It is a ritual act that seems automatic and obligatory. Like a mantra
or a Catholic prayer of ejaculation, its purpose seems more therapeutic and
aesthetic than instructive. It is typically offered as a self-sufficient
commentary, seldom accompanied by specific proposals for correcting the
perceived imbalances. Sometimes, in the unfolding of a meeting or event, it is
possible even to notice identitarians surveying the room, seemingly with only
scant regard to the progress of the meeting’s agenda, doing an inventory of the
groups arguably not represented— in preparation for tailoring the predetermined
intervention to the specific gathering.</p><p>Almost no one ever disagrees with it on principle, and the typical response is
a round of nods of assent and a return to the business at hand. Occasionally,
though, it does provoke rebukes for presumptuousness, most likely when the
intervention comes from newcomers to the initiative that prompted the meeting,
whose incautious and uninformed enthusiasm all too frequently ensues in
theircomeuppance. Self-righteousness, though, can insulate against the
embarrassment of making a fool of oneself in public. I witnessed one such
instance during a Chicago-wide conference of labor and community activists and
progressive elected officials, when an earnest neophyte, armed with the
arrogant self-assurance that can arise only from ignorant true belief,
interrupted the flow of the discussion to protest what she perceived to be the
absence of some significant identity categories among the participants. On
being informed brusquely of the inaccuracy of her perception and chastised for
impertinence by a longtime South Side activist, she responded with indignation
at not having been apprised of the situation sooner. This kind of political
intervention is fundamentally countersolidaristic. Its default posture is
accusation; it is propelled by presumption of others’ bad faith. In its
narrowness and selfrighteousness it parallels left sectarianism in yet another
way. Yet this intervention has an opportunist quality that also displays marks
of its ancestor in black power-era racial politics. A political stance that
pivots on accusations of exclusion or disrespect sets up a role for the accuser
as either a special conduit to— or a proxy for— the excluded or overlooked
constituencies. As I argue in the last two essays in Part One, this motif
underlies a pattern of racially opportunistic practice within predominantly
white liberal and progressive organizations.</p><p>The combination of lack of a coherent critical, strategic vision and the
conviction that generic ascriptive categories are the fundamental units of
political consciousness and action produces a view of a political program as
primarily a vehicle for demonstrating recognition of pertinent identity groups.
This means that programs tend to become simply laundry lists of designer
issues. The logic of identity as an ideological position impels toward defining
issues narrowly enough to fasten them to specific groups. (Apropos of this
mindset, a student recently argued in my seminar, and with passionate resolve,
that the material gains that black Americans experienced through the New Deal
do not count as improvement of blacks’ social condition because they were not
designated for blacks specifically!) That logic also leads to proliferation of
the groups thus recognized, if only by virtue of ever more precise specifying
of identities. The result is an inertial tendency for the list to expand in
number and to become steadily more diffuse as a totality.</p><p>At the same time, the commitment to gross, reified categories as the foundation
of political authenticity turns symbols of recognition into the
least-common-denominator issues held to represent the concerns of specified
groups as singular collectivities. But because they are so general, such
issues— for example, opposition to English-only requirements, defense of
affirmative action, support for Mumia Abu-Jamal— are not likely to animate the
great bulk of people to whom they are presumed to appeal, people whose felt
concerns are much more immediate and mundane. The highprofile, generic issues
are much more meaningful to activists and progressives (you know, the few
hundred of us anywhere who show up for one another’s events and actions) than
to anyone else. This is not to argue that those issues are trivial, just as
noting the wrongheadedness of the identitarian rhetoric of inclusiveness is not
to deny either the importance of building an inclusive politics or the fact
that doing so may require special effort. The point is that these
characteristics of identity politics militate against mobilizing a popular base
broad and large enough to hope to have any significant effect in advancing
democratic and egalitarian interests. In fact, insofar as politics is about the
effort to mobilize an effective base for concerted public action, it may be
improper to call the ideology and rhetoric of identity a politics at all. Its
focus on who is not in the room certainly does not facilitate strategic
discussion of how best to deploy the resources of those who are in the room,
and its fixation on organizing around difference overtaxes any attempt to
sustain concerted action.</p><p>The prominence of identity politics and cultural politics is less the harbinger
of new types of social movements befitting postmodern times, as a group of
scholars of and many propagandists for these approaches would have it, than it
is evidence of demoralization, defeat, historical amnesia, and class insularity
within elements of the left. Cultural politics in particular in some ways
strikingly approximates the Reaganite/Thatcherite view of the world. It
devalues political institutions and processes and elevates private, individual
acts over public, collective engagement. W ithin its purview, as in Thatcher’s
apothegm, there is no such thing as society, “ only individuals and their
families.” Exaltation of “ everyday acts of resistance” is a don’t worry, be
happy politics. If all is resistance, there is no need for concern with
mobilizing collective action, especially because in this view public
institutions are inauthentic or corrupting.</p><p>The perspectives of both identity politics and cultural politics also diminish
the structuring role of political-economic and class forces in shaping the
social order, including its shifting forms and constellations of identity.
Notwithstanding potted disclaimers to the contrary, both reject organizing on
an explicit class basis as a strategy for building a movement capable of
fighting for a just and egalitarian society; in doing so, they embrace a
different class base implicitly. In fact, in reducing politics to gestures and
poses, both imagine a social movement without a foundation in willful,
painstaking, highly labor-intensive organizing of any sort.</p><p>Defenders of identity politics would argue, rightly, that class is itself an
identity and that class politics is, therefore, also an identity politics. The
crucial distinction is not that class is in some way more real or authentic
than other identities, though it is certainly possible to argue that in this
society class— as functional location in the system of social reproduction— is
the social relation through which other identities are constituted and
experienced within political economy. Even without elaborating that theoretical
argument, however, there is a pragmatic justification that is sufficient for
taking class as the identity around which to organize. The goal of building a
mass movement— and there is no way other than such a movement to pursue
progressive social transformation with any chance for even partial or
contingent success— requires proceeding from those identities that unite as
much of the society as possible around a vision and program that most directly
challenge the current power relations. For the vast majority of people in this
country— of all racial classifications or identities, all genders and sexual
orientations— the common frame of reference is the employment relation, the
fact of working, or being expected to work, a job. Moreover, the concerns and
aspirations that are most widely shared are those that are rooted in the common
experience of everyday life shaped and constrained by political economy— for
example, finding, keeping or advancing in a job with a living wage, keeping or
attaining access to decent healthcare, securing decent, affordable housing,
pursuing education for oneself and intimates, being able to seek or keep the
protection of a union, having time for quality of life, being able to care
adequately for children and elders, having access to good quality public
services and social infrastructure.</p><p>A politics focused on bringing people together around such concerns and the
objective of collectively crafting a vehicle to address them is a politics that
proceeds from what we have in common. It is a politics that, like trade
unionism, presumes a concrete, material basis for solidarity— not gestures,
guilt-tripping and idealist abstractions. To the extent that differences are
real and meaningful, the best way to negotiate them is from a foundation of
shared purpose and practical solidarity based on a pragmatic understanding of
the old principle that an injury to one is an injury to all.</p><p>This is not simply a politics that attempts to build on a base in the working
class; it is a politics that in the process can fashion a broadly inclusive
class identity that clearly encompasses all sorts of working people— both
employed and unemployed or on what remains of public assistance. This is the
politics we so desperately need and have needed for all of our lifetimes and
much longer. We cannot construct it with potted narratives, global
abstractions, wish fulfillment or solipsism. We can create it only through
direct organizing and mobilization within the class, at the level of the
neighborhood, the workplace and the union, and it can be created only by
recognizing that it does not yet exist. A truly popular politics of this stripe
cannot be built, especially not in its early stages, mainly through big events.
It grows much more from one-on-one interaction and with small groups of
coworkers, neighbors, friends and other associates.</p><p>Part of the intellectual work of this kind of organizing is cultivation of an
ongoing discussion, linked to practical political activity, around making
collective sense of how the social order and its mystifications are reproduced
on a daily basis. The essays collected in this book are episodic attempts to
stimulate and contribute to that discussion. They cohere around a premise that
understanding American politics, and organizing effectively to operate within
it, requires recognizing the centrality of class forces and dynamics in shaping
consciousness and establishing both lines of cleavage and possibilities for
solidarity.</p></p></div><div class=page-footer></div></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><div class=footer-mobile-links></div><script src=https://number-25.github.io/classletters/js/main.min.a7205ef73b078c8daed6fe1b0826e8ba229ffabbb69d299d9446cf41f2c7d8aa.js integrity="sha256-pyBe9zsHjI2u1v4bCCbouiKf+ru2nSmdlEbPQfLH2Ko=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
