interested in Marxist thought, whether as history of ideas or as ideas of
history, you find yourself quite regularly surprised. You may find yourself
startled even, at the character of some of what you encounter. I offer here a
modest compilation of examples, with accompanying critical commentary. The
principles governing the compilation are few. Examples are all from writers of
the Left and from writings of the 1980s. Seven broad types of argument are
reviewed; each type prominent within contemporary socialist discussion - though
I make no claim to their being exhaustive of the genre of criticism they
represent. Together, the assembled examples provide a kind of snapshot of
something, that is all. The sequence of them is interrupted here and there by a
digression.</p><h2 id=1---smiling-marxists>1 - Smiling Marxists</h2><p>Obloquy&rsquo;, as generally understood, means something very pronounced: speaking
ill of a person or - as it may also be and is here - tradition of thought. I
use the word in that sense. Instances of the first type of obloquy, which I
shall be considering in this section, are unified by (loosely speaking) their
style rather than their substance. They differ in that from the six types to
follow, whose unity is thematic. The style defining the first type of obloquy
is that of the quick, casual disparagement, untroubled by effort of serious
proof or even advocacy: the small, avoidable falsehood or light minded
absurdity; the rendering of an opposing viewpoint in transparently
prejudicial terms; the passing caricature or easy oversimplification; each of
these generally in cahoots with others like it in the same text - for authors
permitting themselves one usually permit themselves many - and cumulatively
producing a not very good impression of their object. Here are some examples of
such a &lsquo;style&rsquo; of recent critical discussion.</p><p>Jon Elster gives his readers to
understand that Marx may have thought &rsquo;each individual&mldr;has all the
capacities that any other has&rsquo;, a view he finds &rsquo;extremely&rsquo; utopian, &lsquo;by its
denial of any genetically determined differences in ability.&rsquo; Curious here is
that in support of the suggestion he adduces but one line from the <em>Grundrisse</em>
which speaks, in a general way, about the artistic and scientific &lsquo;development&rsquo;
of individuals in a prospective - better - future. This seems different from
saying that everyone has identical inherent abilities. It is all Elster offers.
Except, that is, for a broad gesture towards &rsquo;the corpus as a whole, which
never to my knowledge refers to differences in natural talents.&rsquo; Also curious
is that there is a famous passage in the <em>Critique of the Gotha Programme</em>,
concerning the distributive principles suitable to a post-capitalist order, and
in which Marx says things like: &lsquo;But one man is superior to another physically
or mentally&mldr;&rsquo;; and &lsquo;it [a particular distributive principle] tacitly
recognizes unequal individual endowment and thus productive capacity as natural
privileges&rsquo;; and individuals &lsquo;would not be different individuals if they
were not unequal&rsquo;; and &lsquo;From each according to his abilities, to each
according to his needs!&rsquo; Elster discusses the passage at some length elsewhere
in his own text. Oversights are perfectly possible. How odd, though, unless on
the basis of the clearest statement or entailment to this effect, to credit
someone with the belief that we all have the same natural aptitude to be
sprinters, or weightlifters, or mathematicians.&rsquo;</p><p>There is a certain kind of socialist, according to John Keane, by whom it is
supposed that &lsquo;under conditions of genuine socialism&mldr;all decisions in
public affairs, no matter how small or insignificant, will be taken directly
by the community as a whole&rsquo;. Whoever else he may be thinking of here, he is
anyway thinking of the Marxist kind of socialist, for this is what Marx
supposed, so we are told, in &lsquo;a species of the collective harmony myth&rsquo;: &lsquo;All
communist beings would make decisions on all public matters, no matter how
insignificant, and without resorting to separate political institutions for
securing agreements or reconciling conflicts.&rsquo; Amongst the many and difficult
problems Man bequeathed to the Marxist tradition through what he did and did
not say about the regulative institutions of a future communist society, this
one had, I confess, hitherto escaped my notice: that everybody would have to be
directly involved in the siting of each road sign. I had come across Marx&rsquo;s
references to the continued existence of a &lsquo;public power&rsquo; and the mechanism of
elections; Engels&rsquo;s scepticism towards the notion of being able to dispense
with the &lsquo;authority of the majority over the minority&rsquo;; some reflections, even,
of August Bebel, concerning &lsquo;democratic&rsquo; elections to &lsquo;positions of trust&rsquo; in a
central administration, with the possibility of recall and re-election &lsquo;if this
is demanded by circumstances or the electors deem it desirable&rsquo; - and had come
across a bit more yet (some of it to be detailed later) pointing to a picture
of communist public affairs slightly more mediated and less harmonious than
Keane suggests. Keane is perhaps exaggerating. But how odd to exaggerate so.<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><p>How very odd, really, when you reflect upon it, a society of people endowed
with exactly the same natural talents; or of people all directly deciding about
everything, &rsquo;no matter how small&rsquo;. It would be itself, doubtless, excessive
were we to say of this form of discourse about Marxism that it turns your
average Marxist into someone who thinks all humankind will be permanently
smiling &lsquo;after the revolution&rsquo;; or into someone whose beliefs are consonant
only with the wearing of an inane grin. Stuart Hall commends Antonio Gramsci:
&lsquo;Where Gramsci departs from classical versions of Marxism is that he does not
think that politics is an arena which simply reflects already unified
collective political identities, already constituted forms of struggle.&rsquo; This
is good for Gramsci but bad for classical Marxism. To that category we may take
it Marx belongs, and Luxemburg and Lenin also. Now, it seems hard to give a
clear meaning to Lenin&rsquo;s thinking on the revolutionary party, or on the
strategy of proletarian-peasant alliance in pre-1917 Russia, if it was a
matter for him of already unified collective political identities. Equally,
it is hard on such a basis to understand the mass strike&rsquo;s significance for
Luxemburg: as formative, educative, unifying indeed; as constitutive of a new
and active, self-governing political identity for the working class. These two
were familiar with the distinction Marx made between a class-in-itself and a
class-for-itself, and with what it implied about long, difficult struggles,
about learning from the experience of them, about interruptions and defeats.
Stuart Hall is familiar with the same distinction. He calls it &lsquo;Marx&rsquo;s
formidable distinction between a class &ldquo;in itself&rdquo; and one which has developed
sufficient political, cultural and strategic unity to become an active force in
history- &ldquo;for itself&rsquo;&mldr;&rsquo; This seems rather better for classical Marxism. It
could be the difference between Gramsci and less saintly figures in the
tradition is poorly formulated.<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></p><p>&lsquo;Marxism&rsquo;s more scientific adherents&mldr;implicitly assumed the God&rsquo;s eye view
of a transcendental, monological meta-subject able to grasp the whole from a
presumed point exterior to it.&rsquo; So says Martin Jay. That is some subject,
all right: with a God&rsquo;s eye, and transcendental, and monological, and meta</p><ul><li>and when Marxism&rsquo;s more scientific adherents have not been so sympathetic to
notions of deity or transcendental subjecthood. It is perhaps merely an
emphatic expression of the well-known and properly lamented tendency towards
dogmatism in certain Marxist circles. No, it is not that. The target is
other; contained in the words &rsquo;to grasp the whole&rsquo;. Jay&rsquo;s target is
&rsquo;totalistic knowledge&rsquo;. What exact pejorative weight falls, for him,
respectively on &rsquo;totalistic&rsquo; and on &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; (as in &lsquo;more scientific
adherents&rsquo;) is hard to say. But such, in any case, are the features of the
historical-materialist enterprise - its aspiration to understand different
forms of society, to explain their general character - which convict Marxism of
the arrogant God&rsquo;s eye view.<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></li></ul><p>Another who is worried about totality is Jean Cohen. The problem which troubles
her is Marx&rsquo;s &lsquo;one single totalizing logic, the logic of a &ldquo;mode of
production&rdquo;&mldr;[S]uch a totalistic theory dangerously excludes the possibility
(which we of the twentieth century ought to know well) that there might be
other modes of domination than socioeconomic class relations, other principles
of stratification in addition to class (nationality, race, status, sex, etc.)&mldr;&rsquo; Note that the said totalistic theory, according to Cohen, does not merely
give primary emphasis to class, nor even just understate, perhaps, the
importance of other modes of domination. It &rsquo;excludes the possibility&rsquo; of them.
Cohen excludes the possibility of things I definitely remember reading: Marx
saying that &rsquo;the general position of women in modem society is inhuman&rsquo;, and
that &lsquo;Labour cannot emancipate itself in the white skin where in the black
it is branded&rsquo;; Engels saying of Germany that a nation which has allowed
itself to be used as &lsquo;a tool of oppression against&mldr;other nations&rsquo; must
entirely renounce that past; Lenin following the two of them in declaring &rsquo;no
nation can be free if it oppresses other nations&rsquo;; Luxemburg remarking on the
special sorrows of children; Trotsky, likewise, writing of the &lsquo;darkness&rsquo; and
&lsquo;dependence&rsquo; of so many childhoods, and that a &lsquo;revolution does not deserve
its name if it does not take the greatest care possible of the children&rsquo;;
and writing of &lsquo;Woman&mldr;at last freeing] herself from her semi-servile
condition&rsquo;; Adorno speaking of &rsquo;the husband&rsquo;s barbarous power over the property
and work of his wife&rsquo; and of &rsquo;the lying ideology which sets up the man as
superior&rsquo;; Deutscher (yes, even in an essay with the title &lsquo;<em>On Socialist Man</em>&rsquo;)
looking forward to the end of &rsquo;the present family, with&mldr;its dependence of
woman and child on father&rsquo; - and so, if need be, on.<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup></p><p>Stuart Hall also has something to say about all this singularity: &lsquo;We cannot
imagine socialism coming about any longer through the image of that single,
singular subject we used to call Socialist Man. Socialist Man, with one mind,
one set of interests, one project, is dead. And good riddance. Who needs &lsquo;him&rsquo;
now&mldr;with &lsquo;his&rsquo; particular sense of masculinity, shoring &lsquo;his&rsquo; identity up
in a particular set of familial relations, a particular kind of sexual
identity? Who needs &lsquo;him&rsquo; as the singular identity through which the great
diversity of human beings and ethnic cultures in our world must enter the
twenty-first century?&rsquo;<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup> These writers, it may be observed in passing, are ever
so contemporary. They invoke the twentieth, or the prospect of the
twenty-first, century; say &lsquo;we ought to know&rsquo; and &lsquo;we cannot any longer
imagine&rsquo;. And they draw all the while a picture of these grinning - and
shrunken - predecessors. Beware when the writer writes, &lsquo;We know, today&mldr;&rsquo;
Does she know, or is that currently the thing to say? And what he knows, was it
perhaps also known yesterday? Was it known by someone, known at least in part?</p><p>Gösta Esping Anderson interprets Lenin: &lsquo;if socialists take parliamentary
democracy seriously, they will betray the proletarian cause by helping obscure
the nature of class struggle. Even worse, their participation will serve only
to perpetuate and strengthen class exploitation, thus delaying the inevitable
revolutionary moment.&rsquo; By contrast with Kautsky, for whom &lsquo;parliamentary
participation can develop the proletariat&rsquo;s capacity for socialist politics,&rsquo;
Lenin is said to have held that &lsquo;participation in bourgeois
institutions&mldr;would corrupt working class politics.&rsquo; This is the same Lenin
as he whose strategic perspective for the Russian workers&rsquo; movement over more
than a decade was summed up thus: &rsquo;there is not, nor can there be, any other
path to real freedom for the proletariat and the peasantry, than the path of
bourgeois freedom and bourgeois progress&rsquo;; who railed against &rsquo;the hoary
Narodnik theory that&mldr;we do not need bourgeois political liberty&rsquo;, and
against &lsquo;anarchism which denies any participation of the proletariat in
bourgeois politics&mldr;in bourgeois parliamentarism&rsquo;; who, in State and
Revolution (Esping Anderson&rsquo;s alleged source), spoke of the benefits to the
proletariat of the &lsquo;wider, freer and more open form of the class struggle&rsquo;
vouchsafed by the democratic-republican type of bourgeois state; who upheld in
fact &rsquo;the viewpoint that it was&mldr;obligatory to participate even in a most
reactionary parliament&rsquo;; that &lsquo;participation in parliamentary elections and in
the struggle on the parliamentary rostrum is obligatory on the party of the
revolutionary proletariat.&rsquo; Esping Anderson feels &lsquo;It is impossible to cling
to Leninism when one engages in empirical analysis.&rsquo; You can see what he
means.<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup></p><p>The list of such examples could be extended at will. But this first
type of obloquy is now sufficiently exemplified. The above instances of it
are all representative of the style: off-the-cuff, belittling - and, upon
examination, feeble. They are not chosen, however, only for the style. They
also signal, loosely, the substantive themes of the other six types of
obloquy, to be pursued after the following short digression.</p><h3 id=snapshot>Snapshot</h3><p>There is any number of reasons, cogent, intellectually arguable, morally
understandable or otherwise worthy of respect, why a person might not be, not
want to be or not choose to call herself or himself a Marxist; and there is
any number of reasons therefore - again, cogent, intellectually arguable,
morally understandable or otherwise worthy of respect - why, Marxist or not,
someone might be critical of this intellectual tradition, whether individual
aspects or whole areas of it.</p><p>They might feel that Marxism to date has had too
little to offer towards a theory of the political institutions necessary for
any genuinely democratic community, deficiency enough when problems of
political mediation will be with us for good. Or might think that, in
historical and social explanation, although Marxism explains something or even
quite a lot, there is too much which it cannot explain. Or might hold, on the
basis of their judgement of whatever evidence they take to be relevant, that
its central theoretical claims are wrong or at least not proven. They might
not wish to appear to identify themselves with a primary emphasis on the effort
to end economic exploitation and class division, in a world with more
inequities than these. Even recognizing the desirability of socialism, they
might doubt its probability, whether because of the discredit brought upon it
by the regimes that have claimed its name, or for older and deeper reasons. Or
they might wonder from where, or from what, credible agencies or strategies of
socialism will emerge. They might feel, from within the &lsquo;inwardness&rsquo; of their
own personal sphere and their sense of its importance to them, that Marxism
will not help them much towards understanding or fulfilment here. Or feel that
its major thinkers have had too little time for problems of moral philosophy,
germane though these are to any project of human emancipation. Or feel, in the
light of a religious or other metaphysical belief, that Marxism has had nothing
or not the right sort of thing to say to them about the most profound meanings
of life and death. They might just think that contributions to our knowledge
of the social world have been too many and varied for it to be sensible to
identify oneself with a label deriving from the name of one man.<sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup></p><p>There is, to put it otherwise, plenty of room for difference with, and for
difference within, this tradition of thought; for serious substantive criticism
of it; for argument over its shortcomings that is precise and worthwhile.
Why, then, with no lack of matter for sober critical discussion, is there on
the Left today such a volume of caricature, ill-informed oversimplification
and generally facile disputation in the treatment of Marxist thought? Note the
specifications of time and milieu in the question. For Marxism has always been
subject to this sort of thing. The sources of it, moreover, were generally not
hard to see: overt political hostility, prejudice and the like. But the same
easy critical themes, the same kinds of misrepresentation and distortion as
were fed by such sources, now come from writers of the Left overtly open to
what is positive in Marxist thought, and sometimes professing, indeed, a form
of Marxism themselves. And they come from them after two decades in which a
flourishing of debate and scholarship in this area has nuanced and enriched
Marxism itself, as well as confounding the more vulgar representations of it
which prevailed at the beginning of the period, during the Cold War. The point
can be accentuated still further. It is possible to identify the themes and
inflections of this new obloquy even confining oneself, as I mostly do here,
to work of some quality: to the writings of serious scholars, some of them of
considerable intellectual standing.</p><p>Whatever the explanation for it, the phenomenon itself is unmistakable.
Amongst writers and academics across a significant sector of the Left, an
impulse has lately grown towards the taking of some &rsquo;extra&rsquo; distance, so to
say, from Marxism. That is the subject of this snapshot: for the record, a
moment of intellectual history when good reasons did not suffice; the actual
standard of some of the reasons put forth.</p><h2 id=2---amazing-reductions>2 - Amazing Reductions</h2><p>There are three common variants of the discursive form to be treated next. Its
theme was foreshadowed more than once in Section I. It is that Marxism is -
inescapably - reductionist. An example of this second type of obloquy, in the
first of the three variants I distinguish, is provided by Jean Cohen. She
writes: &lsquo;The base/superstructure model, according to which the state, law, and
ideology are conceived as determined (&ldquo;in the last instance&rdquo;) by the mode of
production&mldr;implies that political power and domination represent something
else: the social relations of domination of the only sphere with real weight in
the historical materialist framework, the economy.&rsquo; It obviously follows, if
the economy is the only sphere with real weight in the model, that no other
sphere has real weight in it; and it must seem reasonable, if that is so, to
say that the &lsquo;reduction&rsquo; thereby perpetrated &lsquo;precludes the investigation of
the internal dynamics of the political sphere and the nature of the power of
those who occupy its ranks.&rsquo; Cohen says it. She is very quick on the subject of
what Marxism precludes. Before, remember, it was other modes of domination than
class; now, it is merely investigation of the dynamics of the political
sphere.<sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup></p><p>This first variant is the simple one. It simplifies. Marxism has here been
rather pared down; reduced, in fact. For Cohen&rsquo;s is not the only version of
the base/superstructure model. What student of Marxism can really be unaware of
that today? She herself allows to peep out at us from between scare quotes the
phrase, &lsquo;in the last instance&rsquo;. It has two immediate associations: a letter
from Engels to Bloch, and the writings of Louis Althusser. Expressly argued in
both is that the economy is not the only sphere with real weight; that it
would be &lsquo;senseless&rsquo; indeed (Engels) so to construe it.<sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup> On a conservative
estimate, this must now have been argued by several dozen Marxist writers.
Cohen just discounts the fact. And, with respect to &rsquo;the internal dynamics of
the political sphere and the nature of the power of those who occupy its
ranks&rsquo;, she discounts a few other things as well. Marx&rsquo;s analysis of
Bonapartism, for example, is mentioned by her in this connection, but as
exceptional only, &lsquo;an extraordinary deviation from the paradigm of class rule&rsquo;.
Also exceptional, one must suppose, would be Thalheimer or Trotsky on fascism,
and Gramsci on hegemony, and Althusser on repressive and ideological state
apparatuses, Miliband or Poulantzas on the capitalist state, virtually the
whole classical Marxist tradition on the difference between
parliamentary-democratic and autocratic forms of rule, and a certain amount of
recent discussion of the notion of relative autonomy -to some of which material
Cohen even refers.</p><p>It seems not to be enough to say that reductionist forms of explanation have
been a problem within Marxist thought, a recurring tendency or temptation
there; and one to which some Marxists may have succumbed more than others. This
sort of critical observation, the import of which is undeniable, would
obviously allow, for the problem, the possibility of solutions; for the
tendency, the existence of other tendencies; for the temptation, a resistance
to it also. It would allow that there might be Marxisms which were not
reductionist. It is a criticism too weak for the tastes of some. There is
more to the matter, however, than taste; arguments would also be to the point.
An argument, in particular, as to why the basel superstructure model might not
be rendered with a base which has real weight but is not the only sphere which
has, would be most pertinent.</p><p>Moving on to a less blinkered variant of this theme, I benefit from the
momentary support of Barry Hindess. Hindess rejects such simplification: &lsquo;No
serious exponent of class analysis maintains that class analysis tells us all
we need to know about the political forces at work in the modem world. The
assertion that we must avoid reductionism is commonplace in the literature
and everyone now presents some version of Marx and Engels&rsquo; insistence that
other elements must be given their due.&rsquo; Further: &lsquo;Marxists have always
insisted that economism is something to be avoided.&rsquo; And: &lsquo;Much of post-war
marxist theory&mldr; has been devoted to developing non-reductionist
interpretations of that base/superstructure model.<sup id=fnref:10><a href=#fn:10 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>10</a></sup> Marxism then, for
Hindess, is more complex than for Cohen. It is not irredeemably reductionist.
If we look again, though, we will find that he thinks, after all, it is
irredeemably reductionist. He offers two criticisms. One, that Marxist theory
has yet to specify clearly &rsquo;the precise mechanisms&rsquo; of the relationship between
base and superstructure, provides a perfectly good issue for critical
discussion.<sup id=fnref:11><a href=#fn:11 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>11</a></sup> But it amounts to the claim that Marxist types of explanation of
political structures and events in terms of class or economic causes have
generally not been good enough; and this is a matter of judgement, in which
Hindess&rsquo;s view will not necessarily prevail with everyone. Talk of &lsquo;precise
mechanisms&rsquo; in the domain of social and historical analysis does nothing to
strengthen the claim. It looks like an attempt, rather, to impose on Marxist
theory standards which no other social theory has yet been able to attain, to
the best of my knowledge. Still, this at least is criticism of a kind that can
be seriously debated.</p><p>Hindess&rsquo;s other criticism is of another kind. It gives us the second standard
variant of the second type of obloquy. It comes down to this, that by their
refusal of reductionism Marxists fall into inconsistency - because they remain
committed to what they refuse. Marxism, Hindess says, &lsquo;has insisted on
maintaining two incompatible accounts of the connections between economic
relations and other elements of social life.&rsquo; Its problem &lsquo;arises not so much
from reductionism as from the attempt to combine apparently opposed
positions: the economy is the ultimately determining element, but other
elements must also be given their due; politics and the state are autonomous,
but only relatively so.&rsquo; Again: &lsquo;Marxism is openly committed to reductionist
principles of explanation (the primacy of class struggle and determination by
the economy in the last instance) - and it insists that other elements must
be given their due.&rsquo; As he also puts this: &lsquo;Class analysis&mldr;promises to
combine an insistence on the irreducibility of political life with the promise
of reductionism. But how the trick is done remains obscure.&rsquo;<sup id=fnref:12><a href=#fn:12 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>12</a></sup> Indeed. It
would have to; until someone comes up with a way of fulfilling mutually
incompatible promises.</p><p>It escapes Hindess&rsquo;s reckoning, evidently, that a Marxist for whom political
life, the state, or whatever, is not reducible to a mere expression of
economic structures or of class interests, is then not committed rather than
still committed to reductionist principles of explanation. One who believes
that &lsquo;other elements must be given their due&rsquo; will not generally believe this
together with the view that economic structures explain everything, but will
believe it together with the view that they do not. The conviction of a
relative autonomy, a specific effectivity, of superstructures - as in, say, the
work of Althusser - is not simply added on to a notion of the base as sole
effective historical determinant. It undoes it. &lsquo;Primacy&rsquo; of class and &rsquo;last
instance&rsquo; determination in such a context no longer signify, therefore, the
same (reductive) promise of an &lsquo;only sphere with real weight&rsquo;. They signify
something less weighty than that. The logical point here is elementary and
its neglect a little puzzling. To use again an analogy I have drawn elsewhere,
it is as though someone, thinking a certain family was composed entirely of
vegetarians, were then to find that several members of it regularly ate
beef, and say: &lsquo;These are not so much vegetarians as inconsistent eaters.
Their meat-eating is incompatible with their open commitment to&mldr;well,
vegetarianism; as manifested in their continuing to eat a lot of Brussels
sprouts and spinach.&rsquo; At the risk of labouring a point: vegetarianism is not
the eating of many vegetables. And reductionism is not the hypothesis of an
explanans thought to be weighty, even very weighty. And if one simply lays it
down that &lsquo;primacy&rsquo; of class or &rsquo;last instance&rsquo; determination must stand for
something all-explanatory, and hence incompatible with relative autonomy and
the like, the question is: why must it?<sup id=fnref:13><a href=#fn:13 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>13</a></sup></p><p>We have come back to the place we were before. We could still do with an
argument, some reasons, why the base/superstructure model might not be
rendered with a base which has real, even preponderant, but not total
determining and explanatory weight.</p><p>The third variant of this disparaging theme consists precisely of the denial of
such a &lsquo;middle&rsquo; way. There can be no third way, it is claimed, between a
reductionist conception giving total explanatory weight to class, the economy,
etc., on the one hand, and a simple pluralism of factors or elements, on the
other. The contention, thus nakedly exposed, is inane. It forbids the
possibility that one thing might just be more important than others.
Unrepresentable in this form, it is nevertheless a contention that is
remarkably common with contemporary critics of Marxism. It sidles unobtrusively
out of their prose. Here it is, for instance, from Christopher Pierson:</p><blockquote><p>The point is not to deny the interdependence of state and economy or, more broadly conceived, of state and society but rather to challenge the claim that the nature of this state can be derived from, for example, the &lsquo;irreconcilability of class contradictions&rsquo; or &rsquo;the capital form&rsquo;. For such a claim necessarily entails the subordination of political (and ideological) struggle to economic forms and a sublimation of struggles around differing political axes to struggles based upon class. The consequence of this Marxist position seems to be that (all) politics is, in some sense, class politics.&rsquo;<sup id=fnref:14><a href=#fn:14 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>14</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>The movement of thought here is: interdependence is fine; but to assign a
Marxist-type priority within the interdependence &rsquo;necessarily entails&rsquo; that
class is all. Primacy then - as a matter not of what has sometimes been
done, but of logic - is wholesale reductionism. As to why a Marxist might not
think class generally more important than other &lsquo;axes&rsquo; without going quite this
far, no reason is offered. None could be. It is what plenty of Marxists have
actually thought.</p><p>Now, here is the same sort of thing from Martin Jay:</p><blockquote><p>To avoid the reduction of the whole to a mere aggregate of disparate and autonomous elements, Marxist holism necessarily sought to locate an essential level of deterinination within the whole&mldr; Even when Louis Althusser attacked Hegelian Marxism for its expressivist notion of the totality, he held on doggedly to the belief in a dominant structure, an economic mode of production that was determinant in a last instance that paradoxically never came. With the collapse of the Althusserian project. . .the search for a privileged key to unlock the structural mechanism determining the whole has been all but abandoned.<sup id=fnref:15><a href=#fn:15 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>15</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>&lsquo;Essential level&rsquo; in the first sentence has to be taken in the sense of an
original essence, to which all other levels are related as its epiphenomena -
an inference, this, from the next proposition, about Althusser having
attacked &rsquo;expressivist&rsquo; notions of totality. It may be asked, therefore, why
the quest for such an absolutist centre is said here to be a &rsquo;necessary&rsquo; one
for avoiding the &lsquo;mere aggregate of disparate and autonomous elements&rsquo;. How
about a less simplified social whole, constituted by levels, or sites, or
structures, of differential causal weight, and in which one of them is by and
large preponderant? Not possible, apparently. A vigorous and sustained
argument for just this kind of conception is so characterized (&rsquo;<em>Even&mldr;Althusser&mldr;held on doggedly etc.</em>&rsquo;) as to suggest that it is not a genuine
option logically: eschewing the &lsquo;mere aggregate&rsquo;, did Althusser not fall back,
with that &lsquo;dominant structure&rsquo;, on an expressivist essence? We learn at the
finish that the search for what Jay calls, neutrally, &lsquo;a privileged key&rsquo;
to the social whole is now all but abandoned. He names a few people who
have abandoned it. Once more, however, there is not the hint of a reasoned
argument. Names alone cannot show why there is no logical space for thinking,
for example, both that a fundamental feature of certain societies is that they
are capitalist societies and that this is not the only significant feature of
them.</p><p>As for a last instance, here is one. It comes in the shape of a question from
Les Johnston. The question is formulated not as expecting an answer, but
rhetorically, to encapsulate a problem which Marxism supposedly cannot
resolve. &lsquo;If class struggle is given primacy over state institutions, how
does one recognize the effects of those institutions?&rsquo; That is the question.
Amazing but true. If <em>p</em> is primary, how can e be recognized as having effects?
Johnston is not brought up short by it. To him it makes the best possible
sense. He is, you see, like Barry Hindess, a partisan of the radical
contradiction in Marxist thought, the &lsquo;classical dilemma&rsquo;: of the state as
reductionist &rsquo;expression&rsquo; or the state as effective &lsquo;means of power&rsquo;.<sup id=fnref:16><a href=#fn:16 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>16</a></sup> Well,
if primacy just is economic reductionism, then Johnston&rsquo;s is a hard
question, indeed. And if primacy is less? This is a hard question for several
people today.</p><p>The issue, the danger, of reductionism has been a serious and a necessary theme
in the history of Marxist thought. But it is now a very tired theme, wheeled
out over and over again, without deliberation or discrimination as to when or
where it might be apt. There is scarcely ever pause to reflect on what is the
difference between explanation that is reductionist and explanation, period.
It is not a sufficient basis for the complaint of reductionism that a given
thinker explains certain features of one phenomenon by reference to certain
features of another. He or she does not have to suppose that there are no
other contributing or conditioning factors at work, or that there are no other
dimensions of the phenomenon to be understood. It is actually banal, but
necessary in this context to observe, that it is integral to the very act of
explanation that some things are picked out, given prominence. A &lsquo;mere
aggregate of disparate elements&rsquo; will not take one very far.</p><p>Marxists pick out class and economic structures because they consider them to
have powerful effects, both shaping and constraining, on institutions like the
state, on political and other social practices. One aspect of this particular
hypothesis, however, deserves to be emphasized. If the state matters, in
Marxist theory, for the dominant economic class, this is by virtue of helping
to stabilize or reinforce that class&rsquo;s economic wealth and power. The state
matters, that is to say, because it is itself not nothing. It is not an
empty space; not a mere appearance; not a facade; not just the same thing as
the dominant class; and not a mere reflection of it. It is - and it matters
because it is (but must I now say &rsquo;not only&rsquo;?) - the site of something
different, separate, substantial: namely, concentrated authoritative and
coercive power. The nature of such power, various modalities of organizing
and dividing it, different ways of wielding or limiting it, exactly whose hands
it is in: these are then, obviously, critical issues. One can grasp this, and
also believe that politics is not quite autonomous, since it is affected,
massively, by the distribution of economic resources.</p><p>Some of these contemporary critics of Marxism could do worse than to ponder the
words of Stuart Hall; not in that same mode we have seen him up to now, which
could only be agreeable to their own inclinations; but speaking, rather, so:
&lsquo;It is well-nigh impossible on the left to affirm the importance and
specificity of a particular level of analysis or arena of struggle without
immediately being misunderstood as saying that, because it is important, it is
the only one.<sup id=fnref:17><a href=#fn:17 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>17</a></sup> The level Hall here refers to is, as it happens, another
level, but no matter. The point is good.</p><h2 id=3---socialist-heaven>3 - Socialist Heaven</h2><p>Obloquy of the third kind, encountered once already in a preliminary way,
occurs when it is suggested that Marx and the tradition coming down from him
look forward to an altogether harmonious and untroubled - sometimes also,
uniform - future condition. In the Marxist vision of it, we are told, a
society without classes will be not merely a radically better society, it will
be out of this world.</p><p>The equality of talents imputed by Elster to Man is criticism of this type. So
is the same author&rsquo;s contention that Marx &lsquo;ignores the conflict between the
self-actualization of man and of men that could arise because the frustration
of unsuccessful individuals is an inevitable by-product of a system that allows
a full development of human talents.&rsquo; What Elster has in mind by this is given
in an example: of the &lsquo;artist or scientist who throughout his life is
desperately unhappy&rsquo;, unable to attain the standards he aspires to.
&lsquo;Precisely because of his great power and insight&rsquo;, he can see how far his
work falls short. According to Elster, &lsquo;It is implicit in Marx&rsquo;s psychology
that he did not believe such cases would arise in communism.&rsquo; Then there is
the &lsquo;mythology of abundance in an Eden of harmony&rsquo;, as formulated by Jean
Cohen; &rsquo;the myth of collective harmony&rsquo;, where &rsquo;no serious conflicts of
interest will arise among individuals or groups&rsquo;, as formulated by John Keane;
and the notion, from Christopher Pierson, that &lsquo;all disputes over which it
makes sense to appeal to democratic forms of conflict resolution would be
eliminated with the transcendence of class society.&rsquo;<sup id=fnref:18><a href=#fn:18 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>18</a></sup></p><p>Taking stock provisionally: everyone with identical talents, no one miserable through failure to achieve their self-actualizing goals, abundance construed as Eden, no conflicts of either individual or group interest, the advent
of universal agreement - it begins to look like a pretty tall order. Actually,
no. The genuine goals of socialism, including of Marxian socialism, have always
been a tali order. The picture here, I think one can reasonably say, is more
hopeless than that. It is hopeless intellectually and hopeless practically.
Such accents are, in any case, pervasive. They are found in writers much
friendlier to Marxism, and more fair-minded, than are (now) those whose work I
have drawn on heretofore. David Held, for example, in Models of Democracy,
itself generally a model of balanced scholarship, propagates, when it comes to
Marx, another of these standard deprecatory themes (to be taken up in due
course as the sixth category in the present typology). Excerpted from it, we
have this: that &lsquo;in communism all remnants of classes will have disappeared
and with them the basis of all conflicts&rsquo;; and that it will then be the case
that &rsquo;everyone agrees on basic matters of public policy&rsquo;. Kate Soper, too,
referring to &lsquo;certain sources of tension in human relations&mldr;not traceable
to economic causes. . .[and which] would persist even in societies that had
corrected major iniquities and forms of exploitation&rsquo;, throws doubt on whether
Marx was aware of such other sources of tension. It &lsquo;might be mistaken&rsquo;, she
says, to suppose he thought them eradicable; &lsquo;whether he did so or not&rsquo;, the
expectation is &lsquo;problematic&rsquo;.<sup id=fnref:19><a href=#fn:19 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>19</a></sup></p><p>Others agree with this. Martin Jay looks favourably on the more moderate, less
&rsquo;totalistic&rsquo; sensibility he now detects in socialist thought vis-his what came
before. He speaks of the &lsquo;many&mldr;socialist theoreticians who have been
disabused of the goal of complete normative totalization in the Hegelian
Marxist mold&rsquo;; of &rsquo;the yearning for totality&mldr;now all but abandoned&rsquo;; of
&lsquo;a corresponding acceptance of the inevitable imperfections of whatever
social order humans might create&rsquo;; of &rsquo;the utopian hope of perfect
reconciliation&mldr;quietly laid to rest&rsquo;; of &rsquo;the nostalgic cum utopian hope
for total dedifferentiation expressed in the socialism of redemption&rsquo;; and of
&rsquo;the daunting model of a normatively totalized, fully redeemed social
order.&rsquo;<sup id=fnref:20><a href=#fn:20 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>20</a></sup> Daunting it certainly is; all &lsquo;complete&rsquo; and &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; and &rsquo;total&rsquo;
and &lsquo;fully redeemed&rsquo;. For, by a twist, the vision is not really that
perfect, after all. This is supposed to be for human beings: embodied,
emotional, thinking, heterogeneous sort of folk. Stuart Hall: &lsquo;Who needs a
socialist heaven where everybody agrees with everybody else, where everybody&rsquo;s
exactly the same? God forbid.&rsquo; Quite. Who needs it?</p><p>Finally, for good measure, here is Jon Elster once more:</p><blockquote><p>Marx never to my knowledge discussed these [retardation, mental illness, senility] or other fatalities that mav befall men. such as disease or accident, nor does he refer to the implications of man&rsquo;s mortality. Yet the limited and unknown span of human life has profound consequences for human nature, as has also the constant possibility of debilitations of various kinds.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>The judgement is offered in connection, not with Marx&rsquo;s thinking about a
classless society, but with his view of human nature. It has a bearing,
nevertheless, on our present preoccupations by the suggestion of a certain
inattention on Marx&rsquo;s part to permanently troublesome features of the human
predicament aside from class. One who would pass over the consequences for human
nature of such matters as senility, disease, accident and the implications
of human mortality, might very well have set in train a fully redeeming,
rather smiling sort of tradition.</p><p>There are grounds, all the same, for thinking that these various claims and
characterizations do not give an altogether rounded or accurate picture of the
tradition in question. In his &lsquo;Preface&rsquo; to the Critique of Political Economy,
Marx talks of the &lsquo;bourgeois mode of production&rsquo; as &rsquo;the last antagonistic
form of the social process of production&rsquo;. It is a well-known Marxian thesis.
But he also, and immediately, specifies: &lsquo;antagonistic not in the sense of
individual antagonism but of an antagonism that emanates from the individuals&rsquo;
social conditions of existence&rsquo;. He is plainly alluding to class antagonism.
Do not say now: but for Marx all antagonism is, at bottom, class antagonism.
That is in question. One would need to explain why, if it were so, he should
feel it appropriate to enter the qualification he does: antagonistic not in
this sense but in that. The &lsquo;Preface&rsquo; could scarcely be described as one of
Marx&rsquo;s more obscure texts. It would seem to leave space (pace Keane) for
serious conflicts of interest among individuals, unsettling the myth of
harmony.<sup id=fnref:21><a href=#fn:21 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>21</a></sup></p><p>In The Holy Family, Marx discusses punishment. He speaks, in a way unlikely
to surprise anyone, of the need to destroy &rsquo;the anti-social sources of crime&rsquo;.
But he says also, with reference to Hegel&rsquo;s theory of punishment, that &lsquo;under
human conditions punishment will really be nothing but the sentence passed by
the culprit on himself. No one will want to convince him that violence from
without&mldr;is violence which he had done to himself.&rsquo;<sup id=fnref:22><a href=#fn:22 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>22</a></sup> This will doubtless
strike many readers as a quite utopian idea of punishment and , for all I
know, it is. Notice, however, that even a utopian idea of punishment
entails the thought that under what Marx here calls human conditions there
might still be something to &lsquo;punish&rsquo;: wrong-doing, hurt or harm by some to
others, that sort of thing. Marx&rsquo;s earlier writings, it is generally
acknowledged, tend rather more to utopianism than does his mature work. This
one of them, at any event, is not so utopian as to envisage a world in which
people never trespass against one another. With the &lsquo;Preface&rsquo; passage
aforementioned, it leaves space for doubting (pace Held) that Marx thought the
basis of all conflicts would disappear with classes.</p><p>In the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, reflecting on the power of money, Marx invokes, once again, the prospect of more human conditions.</p><blockquote><p>Assume mon to be mon and his relationship to the world to be a human one: them you can exchange love only for love, trust for trust, etc&mldr; if you want to exercise influence over other people, you must be a person with a stimulating and encouraging effect on other people&mldr;If you love without expecting love in return - that is, if your loving as loving does not produce reciprocal love; if through a living expression of yourself as a loving person you do not make yourself a beloved one, then your love is impotent - a misfortune."</p></blockquote><p>Marx shows himself aware of a source of personal unhappiness not (generally)
attributable to class. That is not so remarkable. It is a widely experienced
form of adversity, misfortune in love. Equally unremarkable, in virtually any
other context than this, would be the implication in the above lines that, even
in the &lsquo;good society&rsquo;, there might be occasions of mistrust; more and less
trustworthy people; failures to influence others; even persons dissatisfied,
perhaps, through not being possessed of &lsquo;a stimulating and encouraging effect&rsquo;
on those around them. Here, it is all relevant. With the &lsquo;Preface&rsquo; and Holy
Family passages aforementioned, it shows an awareness on Marx&rsquo;s part (Kate
Soper&rsquo;s doubts on this score notwithstanding) of sources of tension in human
relations not traceable to economic causes.</p><p>Turning now from the matter of interpersonal disharmony to other issues, I
contest Jon Elster&rsquo;s suggestion that Marx did not believe there would be cases
of frustration in communist society due to failed or incompletely realized
creative projects; cases of people unhappy through having fallen short of
their own ideal aims-and-standards. Marx&rsquo;s vision, to be sure, was
one of all-around self-development or self-realization. But the evidence that this was not understood by him in any simple-minded spirit is right there
in Elster&rsquo;s hands, in a familiar passage from the Grundrisse which informs his
own discussion of the point. Marx argues &rsquo;that the individual, &ldquo;in his normal
state of health, strength, activity, skill, facility&rdquo;, also needs a normal
portion of work, and of the suspension of tranquillity&rsquo;; that the &lsquo;overcoming
of obstacles is itself a liberating activity&rsquo;, a medium of &lsquo;self-realization&rsquo;;
and that to comprehend work thus &lsquo;in no way means that it becomes mere fun,
mere amusement, as Fourier, with grisette-like naivete, conceives it. Really
free working, e.g. composing, is at the same time precisely the most damned
seriousness, the most intense exertion.&rsquo;<sup id=fnref:23><a href=#fn:23 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>23</a></sup></p><p>It is not consistent with the sensibility here displayed that Marx could have
overlooked the possibility - in any kind of society - of people sometimes
failing or falling short in such enterprises, and of the potential meaning to
them, emotional or psychological, of doing so. He knew something of what he
spoke in this regard. In the nature of an obstacle, especially such as must
call forth intense exertion to overcome it, is that it will not always be
overcome; and in the nature of intense exertion is that, failing in its
purpose, it often brings serious disappointment. It may well be that, in
context of his overall expectations about communism, Marx would have thought
disappointment so generated or, worse, unhappiness, to be of another and more
bearable order, or just more acceptable morally, than the miseries and
injustices he wrote of at length and lamented. But that is something different
from what Elster so freely imputes to him.</p><p>I challenge, equally, the facile mockery by which Jean Cohen suggests (in
plenty of company, it should be said) that the type of communist
&lsquo;abundance&rsquo; Marx must have had in mind is obviously ridiculous. I have
argued elsewhere, in a way I merely summarize here, that where in <em>Critique of
the Gotha Programme</em> he anticipates a time when &rsquo;the springs of co-operative
wealth flow more abundantly&rsquo; (my emphasis), Marx does not say enough to
indicate precisely what sort or level of abundance he envisages. We know
from other evidence that he does not mean only a sufficiency relative to
some minimal standard of subsistence. But there is no textual basis for
supposing, either, that he entertained the fantastic notion of a plenty
without limits. We have a text that suggests otherwise: that, &lsquo;in all
social formations and under all possible modes of production&rsquo;, there must
be a &lsquo;realm of necessity&rsquo;; a sphere, in other words, of labour that is
&lsquo;determined by necessity and mundane considerations&rsquo;, by the imperative of
maintaining and reproducing life. Given the high value Marx placed on free
time - time beyond this sphere of necessity, time for autonomous individual
development - any society, even a communist one, which must limit this kind
of good in order to provide others, still lies within recognizable
boundaries of a form of economic scarcity. The conclusion is unavoidable
that what Marx looked forward to was a satisfaction of human needs, material
and other, which, as ample or generous as it might be, would have to meet
some standard of what was economically possible and socially
&lsquo;reasonable&rsquo;.<sup id=fnref:24><a href=#fn:24 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>24</a></sup></p><p>One cannot help being struck by a certain light mindedness in the dismissive,
parodying way so many have with this Marxian theme, when large numbers of human
beings still fall some way short of being able to enjoy any such standard; and
a rather large number of these some way short even of a minimal sufficiency.
Was that not the principal point of the man&rsquo;s life&rsquo;s work? Was it to entice an
already flourishing humanity with dreams of boundless riches?</p><p>I beg, further, to differ with the opinion that Marx never discussed such
features of the human condition as senility, disease, accident, or the
implications of human mortality. Naturally, since these implications are many
and varied and the said features, taken all in all, make up a large
subject, one will be able to think of a lot which he did not say about it.
Should he have said everything? There seems on occasion to be an
unspoken, unconscious assumption, shared by some critics of Marx with the
most dogmatic Marxist fundamentalism, that his ideas ought to have been
completely comprehensive. Short of so extravagant an assumption, the only
worthwhile question raised by Elster&rsquo;s opinion is whether Marx displayed a
sensitivity to the permanent problems of human frailty and finitude. Well, he
knew - this has actually to be written - that death is harsh, &lsquo;a harsh
victory of the species over the particular individual&rsquo;; and that as a living,
material being the human being is a limited, sentient being: &lsquo;Man as an
objective, sensuous being is therefore a suffering being - and because he
feels that he suffers, a passionate being.<sup id=fnref:25><a href=#fn:25 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>25</a></sup> And Marx not only knew but
discoursed lengthily on at least some significant implications of this
mortality and propensity for suffering. He observed, for example, that
the duration of people&rsquo;s lives is of consequence to them and that it
matters if their lives are shorter than necessary; or are afflicted by
avoidable accident, injury and disease; or are so toilsome and oppressive
that they become, these people, &lsquo;prematurely&rsquo; old. I offer a handful of
references to Chapter 10 of the first volume of Capital.<sup id=fnref:26><a href=#fn:26 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>26</a></sup> Marx knew also
that in communist society the labour of those who could, must make provision
for those who could not (any longer) work.<sup id=fnref:27><a href=#fn:27 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>27</a></sup> Did he have to spell out the
various &lsquo;debilitations&rsquo; in the human predicament in letters of fire?</p><p>So much for Marx himself. As to the tradition he began, I shall do no more, in
concluding this section, than to sample some of the kinds of reflection to be
found in its later thinkers. Isaac Deutscher wrote of death as a tragedy
besetting humankind, and of aggressive drives still needing to find outlets
for sublimation under socialism. &lsquo;We do not maintain,&rsquo; he wrote, &rsquo;that
socialism is going to solve all predicaments of the human race.&rsquo; Herbert
Marcuse, likewise, wrote of the &lsquo;ultimate necessity&rsquo; of death; but of the
exigency also of fighting for the difference between &lsquo;death after a fulfilled
life&rsquo; and dying before one must. Leon Trotsky reflected on the &lsquo;inexorable
arch between birth and the grave&rsquo;, on the beauty of youth in the light of old
age and death: on the &lsquo;pang of pity&rsquo; experienced for the vanished youth of a
loved one. Rosa Luxemburg spoke of the anguish and the conflicts born out of
physical disability &lsquo;beyond all human interference&rsquo;. And August Bebel (with
how many others?) wrote of socialist society taking care of &lsquo;its aged, sick
and incapacitate.<sup id=fnref:28><a href=#fn:28 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>28</a></sup></p><p>Theodor Adorno impugned the notion of some endless &lsquo;dynamism&rsquo;; he could
imagine a future &rsquo;tired of development&rsquo; and willing to &rsquo;leave possibilities
unused, instead of storming under a confused compulsion to the conquest of
strange stars&rsquo;. And he commented on the problem of exclusive personal
relationship, &rsquo;erotic conflict&rsquo; arising out of &lsquo;prior engagement&rsquo;: &lsquo;Even, and
precisely, in a society cured of the anarchy of commodity production, there
could scarcely be rules governing the order in which one met people.&rsquo; And he
thought, Adorno, that we should &lsquo;conceive the better state as one in which
people could be different without fear.&rsquo;<sup id=fnref:29><a href=#fn:29 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>29</a></sup> And then Trotsky, again, did indeed
conceive the better state as a condition marked by certain differences. He
saw it as one in which the planning of towns, and of the environment more
generally, would be of interest not only to technical specialists. Around such
questions would &lsquo;be formed true peoples&rsquo; parties, the parties of the future
for special technology and construction, which will agitate passionately, hold
meetings and vote.&rsquo; Further:</p><blockquote><p>The care for food and education, which lies like a millstone on the present-day family, will be removed, and will become the subject of social initiative and of an endless collective creativeness. Woman will at Last free herself from her semi-servile condition. Side by side with technique, education&mldr;will take its place as the crown of social thinking. Powerful &lsquo;parties&rsquo; will form themselves around pedagogic systems. Experiments in social education and an emulation of different methods will take place to a degree which has not been dreamed of before.<sup id=fnref:30><a href=#fn:30 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>30</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>There may be more &lsquo;dynamism&rsquo; to this than Adorno, for his part, would have
liked. There seems to have been space within the Marxist tradition, in any
case, for thinking - and thinking differently - about some enduring human
problems, about a degree of mundane complexity, imperfection and friction,
beyond the end of class division. There was space for something else (pace Jay)
than full redemption, total dedifferentiation, perfect reconciliation;
something else (despite Held or Pierson) than agreement on all significant
matters of public policy. One could perhaps say, borrowing from a remark of
Terry Eagleton&rsquo;s on William Empson, that this intellectual tradition
understood something - not everything or enough - of the &lsquo;complexity and
ambiguity any programme of social transformation must encompass, without
regarding that transformative end as in any sense unworthy.<sup id=fnref:31><a href=#fn:31 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>31</a></sup></p><h3 id=edgar>Edgar</h3><p>Karl Marx knew a thing or two - and I do not mean about history or political
economy. In 1855, he lost a beloved son, Edgar, who died at the age of eight.
Marx was inconsolable, his family distraught with grief. He wrote, three
months later, to Lassalle:</p><blockquote><p>Bacon says that really important people have so many relations to nature and the world, so many objects of interest, that they easily get over any loss. I am not one of those important people. The death of my child has shattered me to the very core and I feel the loss as keenly as on the first day. My poor wife is also completely broken down.<sup id=fnref:32><a href=#fn:32 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>32</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Marx never to my knowledge discusses the experience of grief in his
theoretical writings. He never discusses grief as a feature of a future
communist society.</p><p>In 1972, Barrington Moore published a book called Reflections on the Causes of Human Misery, in the preface to which he observed:</p><blockquote><p>I am somewhat struck by how little I have had to say about what we loosely call personal unhappiness and misery&mldr;while on the other hand I have always regarded [the various causes of it] as a major source of misery for the mass of humanity. There is nevertheless a reason for this apparent gap. Though some portion of personal unhappiness is probably an inevitable part of human fate, a very large portion is due to institutional causes.<sup id=fnref:33><a href=#fn:33 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>33</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>I am puzzled by the &lsquo;probably&rsquo; here, in view of what precedes it, but that is a quibble.</p><p>A large, creative body of ideas, a tradition of thought, is a complex thing
indeed. It will contain central theses and peripheral themes, original
insights and unresolved problems, exaggerations and other insufficiencies,
intellectual weaknesses as well as strengths. Amongst the weaknesses there
will be false or one-sided hypotheses, actual obstacles to clear or fresh
thinking about a given range of theoretical difficulties. And there will be
also, always, unavoidably - within any such large body or tradition of ideas</p><ul><li>gaps. The gaps may be partial or total. They may be too, in their way, a
kind of obstacle to further thought. But a gap is also a space in which to
think, in which someone else can think. She can think, so to put it, inside
the tradition in which it is a gap; or outside it. Or he can think inside it
but drawing from the outside; or outside it and drawing from the inside; or
think just somewhere astride a line between these different intellectual
regions. There will still be other gaps. It is a difficult business. It is
made no easier by a style of intellectual exegesis which rushes to fill any
gap, even a partial one, with costless frivolities. One must, to a degree,
separate the text from the thinker. All the same, there is the death of the
child, Edgar.</li></ul><h2 id=4---absolute-knowledge>4 - Absolute Knowledge</h2><p>Obloquy of the fourth type occurs when Marxism is said to be a form of
epistemological absolutism. The point of the charge is not that there have been
Marxists given to absolutist certainty, uncritical, dogmatic modes of
thought. It goes deeper: to the very heart of the Marxist (as well as many
another) intellectual project. Since the fundamental reason for the charge -
though not, be it noted, the content of it - is a commitment that Marxism
genuinely owns to, it is not appropriate here, as in earlier sections it
was, to assess this type of obloquy against sundry features of the tradition
it purports to, but does not fairly, characterize. We may gauge it
differently: by inspecting the quality of assertion and argument to be found
in one altogether representative example of the genre. The word now, therefore,
is to John Keane.</p><p>Marx, according to this writer, embraced the &lsquo;positivist assumption that
absolute knowledge of modem civil society and the state&rsquo; was attainable, an
assumption Keane also describes as involving &lsquo;absolute truth claims&rsquo; and -
understandably in the circumstances - as &lsquo;arrogant&rsquo;.<sup id=fnref:34><a href=#fn:34 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>34</a></sup> This &rsquo;traditional claim
to absolute knowledge&rsquo;, this continuation of &rsquo;the intellectualist bid for
power&rsquo;, this pretence of a &rsquo;totalizing meta-discourse&rsquo;, this &lsquo;search for
foundations and totalizing truth&rsquo; - that is the sorry picture that is
Marxism.<sup id=fnref:35><a href=#fn:35 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>35</a></sup> The contrast is most stark between it and what Keane himself
commends, namely, a theory offering &lsquo;accounts of social and political life&mldr;which understand themselves as interpretations&mldr;subject to
self-contradiction, unforeseen social and political developments, drastic
revision.&rsquo; His is a commitment to &lsquo;cognitive relativism&rsquo;: a &lsquo;self-consistent
relativism&rsquo;, and which he qualifies, for its part, as &lsquo;humble&rsquo;.<sup id=fnref:36><a href=#fn:36 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>36</a></sup> It &lsquo;is opposed
to the arrogant search for ultimate truth&rsquo;; to &rsquo;the futile search&mldr;for
definite truths of human existence&rsquo;; devotes itself to &lsquo;disarticulating all
essentialist or absolutist truth claims&rsquo;.<sup id=fnref:37><a href=#fn:37 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>37</a></sup> The indictment is a very strong
one; just so long as the reader asks no questions.</p><p>First question. What, theoretically, underlies this critique? What is the
ground for ascribing to Marx and to Marxism an ambition to absolute knowledge?
It is nothing but this: that Marxists have dared to entertain a concept of
truth. Marx&rsquo;s theory, Keane informs us, &lsquo;falls victim to the assumption,
common to all scientism, that it is true knowledge.&rsquo; Or, as he also says, it
presents &lsquo;its own language game as empirically true&mldr;hence unassailable&rsquo;.<sup id=fnref:38><a href=#fn:38 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>38</a></sup>
There you see it: the assumption of &rsquo;true knowledge&rsquo;; and - &rsquo;empirically true.
. .hence unassailable&rsquo;. It is all the basis to the critique there is. In a
couple of phrases, the equation is made: between knowledge and absolute
knowledge. This, of course, squeezes out any idea intermediate between
cognitive absolutism and cognitive relativism, such as the idea of a
conditional, probabilistic kind of knowledge. It excludes a knowledge which,
while indeed subject to critical questioning and the need for revision in the
light of new theory or evidence, can be provisionally categorized nevertheless
(when it can be) as knowledge. It can be so in virtue of the test of something
outside itself, certain &lsquo;foundations&rsquo; precisely, empirical, objective, realist,
or what have you. These can also, and do all too frequently - as, in Keane&rsquo;s
own words, through &lsquo;unforeseen social and political developments&rsquo; -disabuse
people of what they have wrongly taken for knowledge.</p><p>Scorning as hubris the very assumption of grounded knowledge, Keane&rsquo;s critique
claims not to make any claims to a &lsquo;privileged&rsquo; truth itself, enjoying its
modest place within the discursive plurality it celebrates. We shall see
about that in a moment. His theme, it may be noted first, is much current,
part of a wider philosophical contestation, in which Marxism finds itself in
some good company. A special object, perhaps, of this kind of &lsquo;absolutist&rsquo;
disparagement, still it does not stand alone. It stands, as the basis of
Keane&rsquo;s critique reveals, alongside rather a lot of now Marxist thinkers,
past and present, also cogent enough to believe it necessary, and who tried so
far as they were able, to distinguish truth from falsehood.</p><p>Second (age-old) question. Are we to take it, then, that as Keane will not
avail himself of the assumption that these, his own views are empirically true
or knowledge, he will be willing to forego any claims for them to (let us just
say) intellectual cogency? The answer to this, entirely predictably, is
unclear. For the procedure he favours escapes, he says, the classical
contradiction of relativism: the contradiction that, falling under its own
generalization, it undermines its own truth; or not falling under it, it
falsifies itself, by being itself a truth. It escapes this contradiction,
according to Keane, by presenting itself as only a &rsquo;logic of particularity&rsquo;;
&lsquo;as neither a more universal logic nor a &ldquo;truer truth&rdquo;.&rsquo; And the kind of
critical theory Keane aims at does not &lsquo;presume itself to be a privileged
language gamee.&rsquo;<sup id=fnref:39><a href=#fn:39 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>39</a></sup> May we indeed infer, then, rephrasing our second question,
that between Keane&rsquo;s views, whether about knowledge and interpretation or
about politics and society, and other contrary views, there is nothing to
choose in the way of intellectual cogency? Must we choose in the way that we
choose, say, between flavours of ice cream? Apparently not. &lsquo;Relativism,&rsquo;
Keane says, &lsquo;certainly cannot cling naively to the complacent view (with which
it is often stereotyped by its critics) that &ldquo;every belief about every matter
is as good as every other&rdquo;.&rsquo; Some beliefs - possibly his - can be better
than other beliefs.<sup id=fnref:40><a href=#fn:40 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>40</a></sup></p><p>Third question, therefore. What are the criteria for assessing this sort of
thing? We are surely, now, owed some. And they will need to be free of the
taint of absolutist or &rsquo;essentialist&rsquo; foundations, or else the entire
relativizing construction would seem to be (in the theoretical, not the
psychological sense) fraudulent. So, what are the criteria? None are offered,
none whatsoever. Instead, there is a linguistic sideways hop. The direct
sequel to Keane&rsquo;s statement that relativism does not entail every belief
being as good as every other is this: &lsquo;Relativism rather my emphasis
implies the need for democracy, for institutional arrangements and procedures
which guarantee that protagonists of similar or different forms of language
games can openly and continuously articulate their respective forms of life.&rsquo;
Well, democracy is excellent: for relativists, and for empiricists and
realists also, to speak only of these. It is a superior way of negotiating
matters of political and ethical disagreement. But, here, it is an evasion
of the issue confronting this cognitive relativism: the issue as to how one
belief might be adjudged better than, or not as good as, another. I cannot
imagine Keane could mean that questions of knowledge or, as he would prefer,
interpretation, should be settled by voting; or what he would say, if he does
mean that, as to how one should make up one&rsquo;s mind which way to vote (unless
it be by trying to anticipate the outcome of the procedure itself). If he does
mean that and knows some non-arbitrary criteria for making up one&rsquo;s mind which
way to vote; or if he does not mean it and this is, as it appears, only a
sideways hop; one awaits, as one will endlessly from this kind of intellectual
outlook, some foundation-free means for distinguishing cognitively better from
cognitively worse.</p><p>Meanwhile, one can only observe what the relativist (always) does, as opposed
to says. Here, for instance, is some criticism - you will see how humble -
directed by Keane at Lucio Colletti. He refers to Colletti&rsquo;s distinction
&lsquo;between parliament (which could be eliminated by a future socialist state)
and political and civil liberties, which are inviolable, and thus a
necessary feature of socialism&rsquo;; to his claim that &lsquo;public liberties - the
suffrage, freedom of expression, the right to strike - are not identical with
parliament.&rsquo; And Keane then continues:</p><blockquote><p>This is undoubtedly true [sic]. The liberties of a democratic civil society encompass activities deeper and wider than parliament and its assodated political freedoms. And yet Colletti&rsquo;s hint that civil and political liberties could be presewed and strengthened without parliament forgets their inner connection: the liberties of an active, self-organizing civil society cannot be defended without a central parliamentary assembly, which enables the particular interests of civil society to argue their case and to resolve their differences, openly, non-violently and without state repression. There has never been a political regime which simultaneously nurtured democratic civil liberties and abolished parliament. Nor has there ever existed a political regime which simultaneously maintained a democratic parliament and abolished civil liberties.<sup id=fnref:41><a href=#fn:41 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>41</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>There are reasons for thinking that Keane is substantially right here against
Colletti, with one or two qualifications (concerning, for example, the absence
of state repression; or whether the last proposition is defensible without
tautology). But neither the main substance nor the qualifications are the
point. Look at how Keane talks: &lsquo;undoubtedly true&rsquo;; and &lsquo;forgets&rsquo;; and &rsquo;the
liberties&mldr;cannot be defended&rsquo;, with not so much as a whiff of a
qualification, whether &lsquo;as a rule&rsquo; or &lsquo;generally&rsquo; or &lsquo;probably&rsquo;. And then,
finally: this simply is how it is and always has been, this is the reality
of the thing. If it be said that, oh, it is only a way of talking, I think
one can legitimately ask what entitles someone so to talk, invoking truth and
what gives every appearance of being foundations, empirical or realist, when
it is that sort of appeal precisely that motivates the charge against others
of seeking an absolute God. This is the (nearly?) universal of relativism, a
practice at odds with its own theory, because the theory is itself rather
unpersuasive. In itself, that is not such a terrible thing, after all. Who has
not fallen down, one way and another, trying to explore the treacherous
landscape of knowledge or interpretation? But a genuine intellectual humility
would be more hesitant before condemning as arrogant what it practises itself,
however it may preach.</p><p>Quite how unself-aware this sort of outlook can be, walking quietly away from
every difficulty, may be observed, to conclude here, from the following.
Reflecting on the mutual relation between democracy, on the one hand, and
&lsquo;indeterminacy&rsquo;, &rsquo;the destruction of the old reference points of ultimate
certainty&rsquo;, the refusal of any &lsquo;universal metalanguage&rsquo;, on the other, Keane
contends that to defend democracy is to &lsquo;reject every ideology which seeks to
stifle this indeterminacy by demanding the general adoption of particular forms
of life that are clothed in a broad repertoire of old and new metaphors&rsquo;. He
gives some examples of such ideologies, going on to describe them as inimical
to democracy and containing &lsquo;a fanatical core&rsquo;. &lsquo;Fortified by their Truth&rsquo;,
they seek to &lsquo;crash into the world, throttling everything which crosses their
path.&rsquo; Here are the examples:</p><blockquote><p>Every woman needs a man, as the herd needs the shepherd, the ship&rsquo;s crew a captain, the proletariat the party, and the nation a Moral Majority or Saviour; mankind is the master and possessor of nature; scientific evidence is the most rational criterion of knowledge; capitalism is the chief guarantor of liberty; the end justifies the means; doctors know best; whites arc superior to blacks; and so on.</p></blockquote><p>You see how easy a language game can be. Keane manifestly wants to assemble
some (we must not say untruths, so let us call them) poor generalizations:
discredited, questionable or odious. But the point cannot be made in that way.
For it purports to be about rejecting all &lsquo;ideologies&rsquo;, such as &lsquo;contradict
the particularity of their own language games&rsquo; by calling for &lsquo;general
adoption&rsquo;. He needs consequently to write, if he would put the argument to a
genuine test, something like this:</p><blockquote><p>Every person needs food and shelter, as the flower needs the sun, the ship&rsquo;s crew periodic sleep, citizens civil liberties, and the country a democratic parliament or free press; people do not like&mldr;to be cruelly tortured or slaughtered; critical scepticism is a useful precaution against the claims of intellectual arrogance; capitalist exploitation or other grave social injustices tend to vitiate individual liberties; people have rights against personal violation for the ends of others; doctors know something; a society free of racism is superior to one not free of it; and so on</p></blockquote><p>One does not have to .believe any or all of these to be absolute truths to see
that they are somewhat different from Keane&rsquo;s innocent assembly. It would be
interesting to know how many, and which, of them he would find fanatical or
unworthy of general adoption.<sup id=fnref:42><a href=#fn:42 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>42</a></sup></p><h2 id=5---one-class-of-actor>5 - One Class of Actor</h2><p>Obloquy of the fifth type occurs when an author discovers that a basic form of
Marxian explanation, namely, of political events by reference to class, is no
good at all, not really explanation. Just as in the last section there was no
question of needing to deny that Marxism has been committed to the quest for
knowledge, here too it will not be a matter, obviously, of seeking to show
from the texts that Marxists do not proffer explanations of this form. They do</p><ul><li>sometimes more and sometimes less successfully. It is a matter again of
sampling, in one representative case, the character of argument by which such
explanations are urged to be inherently invalid. Since the case I take is that
of Barry Hindess, it may be recalled that he it was who proposed the thesis
that Marxism is, even when it is not, reductionist. He might have saved himself
the trouble of that. If you cannot explain anything in terms of class, it
seems uneconomical to contort oneself over whether Marxists explain everything
in terms of it, since they undoubtedly do so explain quite a lot.</li></ul><p>Hindess challenges the assumption that &lsquo;classes are themselves collectivities engaged in struggle&rsquo;, that classes are &lsquo;collective actors&rsquo;. According to
him, &lsquo;classes are not social forces at all. Discussion of politics in terms of
class struggle is at best a rather complex allegory and at worst thoroughly
misleading.&rsquo;<sup id=fnref:43><a href=#fn:43 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>43</a></sup> Here is the argument for this:</p><blockquote><p>An actor is a locus of decision and action, where the action is in some sense a consequence of the actor&rsquo;s decisions. Actors&rsquo; decisions play a part in the explanation of their actions&mldr;Reference to an actor, then, always presupposes some definite means of reaching and formulating decisions, definite means of acting on them, and some connections between the two. Human individuals are certainly actors in this sense, but they are dearly not the only things that reach decisions and act accordingly. Capitalist enterprises, state agencies, political parties and trade unions are all examples of actors other than human individuals.</p></blockquote><p>Such collectivities as classes, on the other hand, &lsquo;have no identifiable means of formulating decisions, let alone of acting on them.&rsquo; To treat as actors &lsquo;collectivities that have no means of formulating decisions&rsquo; is to provide, says Hindess, &lsquo;a spurious explanation&rsquo;.<sup id=fnref:44><a href=#fn:44 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>44</a></sup> The whole critical job has been done with a definition.</p><p>We might, of course, question the definition, but let us not. Let us accept
it. Classes are not, then, actors. But why may they not be &lsquo;social forces&rsquo;
still, and there be social forces other than actors, of some explanatory
importance? Or if &lsquo;forces&rsquo; are definitionally equivalent with &lsquo;actors&rsquo;, why
may classes not be social aggregates of another kind than actors and forces,
and of explanatory importance? Consider, to come to the substance of the
thing, this Collectivity. Large or very large numbers of its members become
aware that some other collectivity or some institution is acting or about to
act in a way prejudicial to what they cherish as their aims. There is within
the Collectivity talk about it, this way and that: informal, spontaneous, in
some places more organized. Sub-groups within the Collectivity, whether
pre-existing or newly formed, structured or loose, confer. Some learn what
others think directly by hearing from them; and some learn what others think
indirectly through what they are told. Inferences are drawn from the known
views of yet others. Partly because of this process, partly because even
without it there is a widely-shared reaction amongst members of the
Collectivity to the threat they perceive, actions now take place of a more or
less consistent or even concerted kind. People take to the streets, say; or use
money or positions of influence towards exerting other sorts of pressure upon
a government.</p><p>Hindess leaves something unclear. Would the kind of process just described be
a &lsquo;definite&rsquo; or &lsquo;identifiable&rsquo; means of formulating and acting upon
decisions? His definition alone, perhaps, does not exclude that it would. In
that case wider and looser types of collectivity than those he cites as
examples could be actors after all and classes be amongst them. But if we
interpret the definition in the light of his examples, he would appear to
require, before we can talk of actors, that there be rule-governed,
formally-constituted decision procedures. For, without exception, all of his
examples are of formal organizations (capitalist enterprises, state agencies,
political parties and trade unions).</p><p>Interpreting him in this light, our Collectivity is no social actor. But so
what? On what basis will it now be said not to be a social force (or
aggregate), and which can be used legitimately in explanation? It is not
relevant, although it is true, that not all members of the Collectivity
participate in deciding upon action and in acting. This is generally the case
also with formal organizations. Nor is it relevant, although it is again true,
that such concerted or convergent actions as are decided on and taken are the
product of a series of individual and sub-group activities. Not only is that,
too, the case with the formal decisions and actions of the organizations
Hindess allows to be genuine social forces. Further, it does not follow from
it that the concerted or convergent actions from within the Collectivity are
reducible without residue, are fully explicable in terms of, these constituent
activities. They will not be so if - as I suppose here, because the
supposition is often enough realistic - these constituent activities are
themselves motivated by objectives (material interests or ideal values) which
members of the Collectivity have formed in virtue of being members of it.</p><p>It is worth noting that the conception of &lsquo;social forces&rsquo; implicit in
Hindess&rsquo;s examples would render formal organizations the rock bottom of valid
explanation in terms of such forces. One could not explain the character or
conduct of these organizations themselves by reference to any wider or looser
social aggregates. If, for example, a particular organization is not merely
random in its social composition, must we then say that more members of one
social group than another just happen, by coincidence, to have joined it? Or if
we say, so as to avoid this conclusion, that more members of one social group
are attracted by the organization&rsquo;s policies and principles, is that
differential attraction itself not explicable to some significant extent in
terms of differential dispositions people acquire by being differently located
within social aggregates of the wider sort?</p><p>The question takes us into a companion argument from Hindess; one impugning
the notion of class interests, interests based upon social location within the
structure of capitalist society. Interests, he says, should not be regarded as
structurally determined: With this second argument I shall&mldr;" be
brief, since its logical deficiency is manifest (and extraordinary). The shape
of it is as follows: peoples reasons for action are not dependent on
structurally defined class interest, because they are also dependent on other
things. Hindess asserts that &lsquo;insofar as interests have an explanatory role, they are
always dependent on definite discursive and other kinds of conditions, and
their identification is always open to dispute.&rsquo; This is so because interests
are effective &lsquo;insofar as they provide reasons for actors&rsquo; decisions&rsquo;; hence
only as &lsquo;conceptions&rsquo;, which are the &lsquo;products of assessment&rsquo;. What reasons for
action ark recognized in a given situation will therefore depend on &rsquo;the
forms of assessment&rsquo; available to social actors. They can depend also on &ldquo;the
work of individuals, political parties, unions and other agencies.&rsquo; The point
seems quite reasonable. But Hindess then concludes from it: &rsquo;the forms of
assessment available to actors are not uniquely determined by their social location. It follows that
the interests actors recognize and act upon cannot be uniquely determined by social location either.<sup id=fnref:45><a href=#fn:45 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>45</a></sup></p><p>If the burden of the argument is - as it is - to disqualify explanation in
terms of social location and its effects through interests, Hindess needs to
tell us and to have established that the forms of assessment available to
actors and the reasons actors have for acting are not at all - or not significantly, at least - governed by social location. That would be a more exacting argument to make. It
is also where his dissertation on this matter began. &lsquo;Not uniquely
determined&rsquo; backs away from it, allowing that actors&rsquo; reasons for action
are - determined by social location to some extent; in which case Hindess&rsquo;s
effort to disqualify class analysis and explanation as at best merely
allegorical fails.</p><h2 id=6---the-end-of-politics>6 - The End of Politics</h2><p>Obloquy of the sixth type occurs when a statement is made to the effect that
Marxists foresee a society without politics. The thesis was lately ventured by
Michael Walzer in New Statesman and Society, the Marxian view of politics as
&rsquo;nothing more than the superstructural enactment of class conflict&rsquo; being said
by him to entail that with the end of social classes &rsquo;there will be no
politics&rsquo;. It is a popular thesis, found in a goodly proportion of the
critics referred to in this essay. Pierson: &lsquo;under communism there would be no
specifically political institutions over which it would be appropriate to seek
to exercise constraint or control&rsquo; but, rather, an &rsquo;end of politics&rsquo;. Jay:
&lsquo;socialist traditions, like Leninism, that promised the end of politics&rsquo;.
Cohen: a &lsquo;communist society without the aid of political institutions&rsquo;, &rsquo;the
dissolution. . .of politics itself, and &rsquo;the Communist Manifesto. . .singing
the praise of the destruction of politics&rsquo;. Keane: everyone deciding about
everything, no matter how small, without the need of &lsquo;separate political
institutions&rsquo;.<sup id=fnref:46><a href=#fn:46 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>46</a></sup></p><p>There is a certain conceptual elision here, most visible, as it happens, in
the writer from amongst all these whose treatment of Marxism is the most
sympathetic one. I mean David Held. In introducing for his part the
end-of-politics theme, Held writes - as is accurate - that the end of the
state for Marx involved &rsquo;the dismantling of politics as an institutionally
distinct sphere in society used in the perpetuation of class rule.&rsquo; Citing,
like Cohen, a well-known passage from the Manifesto in support of this
contention, as well as another from The Poverty of Philosophy, Held then goes
on to offer, however, the following gloss upon them: that &lsquo;since class
relations determine the key dimensions of power and axes of conflict in state
and in society. . .when classes are finally transcended, all political power
will be deprived of its footing and the state - and politics as a distinct
activity - will no longer have a role.&rsquo;<sup id=fnref:47><a href=#fn:47 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>47</a></sup> Note the extension of meaning that
has occurred: from politics in a determinate, particular sense, to &lsquo;all&rsquo;
politics. Note, equally, a debit in the reasoning for this extension: since
&lsquo;key&rsquo; aspects of the stuff of politics disappear, therefore politics tout
court disappears. We shall need to ask if the passages Held cites do, in fact,
license such an extension of meaning.</p><p>Let it be emphasized, first, that it is no part of the argument I shall make,
to suggest that Marx or the tradition after him did offer an adequate theory or
sketch of the political institutions of a classless society. They did not, not
even remotely, and it has been a grievous lack. My point is a more limited one:
that the Marxist canon in this matter contains a space and some resources for
making the deficiency good, and is not just the obstacle, which these critics
one-sidedly depict, to the presently urgent task of elaborating models of a
socialist polity. As the defence to be mounted is thus limited, it may be said
that nothing much turns on it; the more especially since, in trying to make its
deficiency good here, Marxist thought undoubtedly has a lot to learn from other
intellectual traditions, in particular that of liberalism. What difference,
then, whether Marxism is merely an obstacle or whether it leaves room and a few
resources for thinking about the question, when there are in any case
alternative pints of departure? This difference. It matters whether Marxism is
just disabled, by erroneous theses integral to it, from engaging seriously with
the crucial issue of a feasible socialist polity; or whether there is space,
within the framework of Marxism, a gap in the sense of our earlier digression, large but not total, and in which Marxists, as well as anybody else who
wants to, can today work to contribute to the discussion of that issue. The
sixth type of obloquy would abolish such space. What follows displays it.</p><p>Let us consider what it is, precisely, that is invoked to support the
projection of an end of politics, following upon the end of classes. Beyond the
notion of communist uniformity - that everyone in a classless society will be
the same and or agree about everything including matters of public policy - it
is the classical formula of the withering away or abolition of the state. I
simply set aside the former notion, of uniformity, as not founded on anything
substantial, and incapable consequently of furnishing a defensible basis for
the theme. It is contradicted not only by texts cited in Section III above,
but also by two central and perfectly familiar Marxian theses, when taken in
conjunction. The first is that communism will achieve a conscious, collective
control over social and economic processes which have hitherto escaped such
control and indeed understanding, having taken place &lsquo;behind the backs&rsquo; of
individuals. The second - another side, this, of Marx&rsquo;s expectations
concerning communist disalienation - is the thesis of an unprecedented
flourishing of human individuality. Giving the lie as it does (just like that)
to the talk about universal &lsquo;sameness&rsquo;, this second thesis also prompts one to
ask how likely it is that Marx might have thought people, all of them, under
such conditions of a flourishing individuality, would agree about all
matters; and all matters to do with the public life of a large, modem society.
It is unlikely. This is, to be sure, merely an inference. But it is an
inference from something real and substantial in his work. One wants the
material that will weigh against it, on the other side of the scale. Man
perhaps did speak also in a contrary sense. Did he?</p><p>I turn to the formula of the end of the state. Now, it falls out that Marx had
a way of expressing this, over and again - in the passages Held and Cohen
give and elsewhere - which seems positively to thrust upon the reader a point
these two, and the other critics, nevertheless overlook. Here is the
Manifesto passage:</p><blockquote><p>When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared . . . the public power will lose its political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely the organized power of one dass for oppressing another.</p></blockquote><p>And, here, the passage from The Poverty of Philosophy:</p><blockquote><p>The working class, in the wurse of its development, will substitute for the old civil society an association which will exclude classes and their antagonism, and there will be no more political power properly so-called, since political power is precisely the official expression of antagonism in civil society.</p></blockquote><p>Here, again, is a passage from a less familiar text, the review of a book by Emile de Girardin:</p><blockquote><p>The abolition of the state has only one meaning to the Communists, as the necessary result of the abolition of classes, whereupon of itself the need for the organized power of one dass for the suppression of another ceases to exist.<sup id=fnref:48><a href=#fn:48 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>48</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>These formulations reveal the nature of the conceptual elision I have spoken
of. The end-of-politics construct of Marx begins from an independently given
meaning of politics (roughly, interpersonal deliberation, negotiation and
authoritative decision-making in matters of public scope or concern), and then
reads him as saying in such passages as these that all politics, in that
sense, is the product of classes and class antagonism, and so must disappear
with them. But the passages, I submit, are of another import, and virtually
cry out that they are so. Marx offers a different, rather narrow meaning of
politics - &lsquo;properly so-called&rsquo;, by definition, it is class power and class
antagonism - and says that politics, in this sense, will disappear &lsquo;of itself&rsquo;
with classes. The abolition of the state, he writes, &lsquo;has only one meaning to
the Communists&rsquo;, and this is it. But beyond the state so defined, i.e. as
an oppressive class institution, a &lsquo;public power&rsquo; will continue to exist.
Marx&rsquo;s repeated, forcible expression of the point renders the deduction
compelling that &lsquo;politics&rsquo; and a &lsquo;state&rsquo;, on meanings of these terms broader
than the one he here stipulates, would be part of a classless society.</p><p>If, as I propose, the texts cited are so clear on this point, how is it that so
many commentators do not see it, even if only as a sort of shadow falling upon
their chosen theme and which they must try to remove? It is not easy to say.
The point is not an eccentric insight of the present writer. It is
well-covered within modem Marx scholarship.<sup id=fnref:49><a href=#fn:49 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>49</a></sup> It is confirmed, moreover, by
other material in Marx&rsquo;s writings. In Critique of the Gotha Programme, for
example, he writes that &lsquo;Freedom consists in converting the state from an organ
superimposed upon society into one completely subordinate to it&rsquo;; a formula
suggesting not only the continued existence of a kind of (converted) &lsquo;state&rsquo;,
but also its democratic foundation.<sup id=fnref:50><a href=#fn:50 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>50</a></sup> This democratic theme, again perfectly
familiar, recalls and reaffirms the substance of some of Marx&rsquo;s earliest
theoretical reflections: on Hegel, and on the Jewish question.</p><p>Then, too, in his marginal notes on Bakunin&rsquo;s Statism and Anarchy -which yet
once more says of the end of the state: &lsquo;This merely means: when class rule
has disappeared, there will no longer be any state in the present political
sense of the word&rsquo; - Marx makes it plain that the &lsquo;state&rsquo; or &lsquo;public power&rsquo; he
envisages will have an elective basis. It is true that he also speaks of the
subject of elections, in this context, as having become a &lsquo;business matter&rsquo;.
This is read by some as betokening an antithesis with politics. But the
antithesis is with politics in Marx&rsquo;s restricted sense; for what he actually
says is &lsquo;a business matter which does not afford any room for
domination&rsquo;.<sup id=fnref:51><a href=#fn:51 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>51</a></sup> The notion is of a democratic process which, freed from the
contestation of classes, is no longer coercive in character, because Marx
allowed himself to foresee a kind of community that would be willing to respect
the outcomes of democratic deliberation. If even this is, as many will think,
a highly utopian expectation, it is nonetheless a different expectation from
that of an end of politics, in the broad sense. A non-coercive &lsquo;state&rsquo;, in
which elections are democratically contested is one, we must presume, open to
disputes over issues of public policy. Whether such a non-coercive &lsquo;state&rsquo; is
possible or not, it is anyway a terrain of politics, in the meaning that
sundry commentators deny that it is.</p><p>A similar observation must be made concerning the notorious formula that, as
Engels put it, &lsquo;public functions will lose their political character and be
transformed into. . .simple administrative functions&rsquo;. This was not, it has
to be said, a happy usage, and it is not worth defending, much less
perpetuating. Apart from its unlikely suggestion of a prospective simplicity
of functions in a future society, the connotations of &lsquo;administration&rsquo;, as a
(purely) technical sphere, are hard to put aside. Still, here again, it is
not legitimate to abstract from the specifically Marxist - class-coercive -
meaning of &lsquo;political&rsquo;, in interpreting the distinction between politics
and administration. Engels, as was registered earlier, commented witheringly
on the anarchist idea of getting rid of &rsquo;the authority of the majority
over the minority&rsquo;; dismissing the possibility of &lsquo;a society of even only
two people&rsquo; in which each does not &lsquo;give up some of his autonomy&rsquo;. A society
in which there is still the necessity of majorities and minorities, as there
are still (and is implied by) contested elections, would seem to be a space
of public dispute, a space for politics.<sup id=fnref:52><a href=#fn:52 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>52</a></sup></p><p>Lenin, finally, to spare a word for him, believed not only in the end of the
state but also - as we are told by Pierson - that democracy itself, being
&lsquo;simply one form of the state&rsquo;, is &lsquo;destined to &ldquo;wither away&rdquo;&rsquo; with the
disappearance of classes.<sup id=fnref:53><a href=#fn:53 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>53</a></sup> This sounds bad. Is it true? Yes, it is; but
only in a sense. In addition to the circumstance that Lenin, too, made clear
his particular, Marxist understanding of the meaning of the &lsquo;state&rsquo; (&lsquo;The state
withers away insofar as there are no longer any capitalists, any classes, and,
consequently, no class can be suppressed&rsquo;), there is also this: he went to some
trouble to explain that he construed the withering away of democracy just qua
state-form on this meaning. &lsquo;We do not,&rsquo; he wrote, &rsquo;expect the advent of a
system of society in which the principle of subordination of the minority to
the majority will not be observed.&rsquo;<sup id=fnref:54><a href=#fn:54 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>54</a></sup> Around what would minorities and
majorities have been expected by him to form? And should it not be said,
particularly by someone not attached to the narrow Marxist meaning of the
&lsquo;state&rsquo;, that Lenin did not, then, actually anticipate the disappearance
(without qualification) of democracy?</p><p>Looking out menacingly, you see, from behind this figure of the end-of-
politics rendition of Marxism, is a close and a not very pretty friend. Its
presence should not go unremarked. I mean a disposition to give out that
Marxist ideas in this area were (not to put too fine a point on it) proto-
Stalinist. Held puts the thing gently: that Marx&rsquo;s conception, by
delegitimizing disagreement and dispute, implied &lsquo;a propensity to an
authoritarian form of politics&rsquo;. Keane thinks that Marx showed &lsquo;a lack of
respect or enthusiasm&rsquo; for, among other things, the right to vote. Cohen would
have it that, in the communist society Marx envisioned, the &lsquo;private&rsquo; or the
&lsquo;particular&rsquo; was to be abolished, &lsquo;would no longer exist&rsquo;. And Jay is pleased
to note in this fin-de-siecle a &lsquo;widespread reassessment of the value of
bourgeois democracy as more than a mere ideological smokescreen&rsquo; (my
emphasis).<sup id=fnref:55><a href=#fn:55 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>55</a></sup> What is one to say? Such opinions are in themselves unastonishing,
for having been so widely canvassed by now. But one has also come to expect, by
now, with the quantity and quality of available scholarship on Marxism, rather
better than this. You can still be surprised by it in some of the places it is
found.</p><h2 id=7---privilege>7 - Privilege</h2><p>An example of the seventh type of obloquy, the last type of this series,
will not be given. Readers are invited to find specific examples where they
will, for there is today no shortage of them. They occur in discussion of the
interrelationships between socialism, the working class, other types of social
agent or political subject, and the various forms of exploitation and
oppression: economic, gender, national, ethnic, and so on. It is, clearly,
neither a small nor a simple set of issues, and I have no intention of trying
to offer here anything like a thorough or sufficient treatment of them. I
focus merely on one current anti-Marxist trope: that, in postulating a special
connection between the prospect of achieving socialism and the movement and
struggles of the working class, Marxism was and is guilty of a kind of
arbitrary favouritism, privileging this particular agent at the expense of
others, in a would-be universalizing discourse that is actually undemocratic.</p><p>A preliminary question about this is whether proponents of the criticism
themselves regard socialism as a solution to all these aforesaid
different oppressions. Typically they do not. It is, in fact, usually a
companion argument to the one I focus upon that Marxism was wrong to
conceive socialism in such an all-encompassing way, as the precondition for
ending every human oppression; or - in extreme variants of this companion
argument - as automatically bringing with it complete and universal
liberation. The contention, in this extreme variant, is one more
caricature, which I do not bother to contest at length, proffering merely
two or three quite &lsquo;orthodox&rsquo; Marxist reference points to the contrary.<sup id=fnref:56><a href=#fn:56 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>56</a></sup>
That Marxists have generally overstated, however, the interdependence
between achieving-socialism and the overcoming of the other social
oppressions is fair criticism, Beyond continuing to register how different
forms of domination can often feed off and mutually reinforce one another,
socialists have to recognize that socialism, ambitious and difficult of
attainment as it has proved to be, is one goal, relatively distinct from
other emancipatory goals; which are of their own pressing urgency, the
obstacles and resistances to them being the source of plenty human misery
and stifled potentialities. There is still good enough reason for movements
or agencies in support of these several goals to accept and to press the
validity of each other&rsquo;s specific claims. Any battle against one grave
systemic injustice diminishes itself by ignoring other such equally grave
injustices, or by making light of them.</p><p>A contemporary universalism, therefore, may find its basis in the reciprocal
recognition amongst different emancipatory struggles of what they share, as
struggles against injustice or arbitrary power. It should not be founded on a
claim that one such struggle is master or mistress of them all. If a
feminist socialism and a socialist feminism, a socialist anti-racism or
anti-racist socialism, are possible and necessary, still socialism,
feminism and the struggle against racism train their sights on different
objectives, none of which I simply subsumes the others.</p><p>In this light, now, what is to be made of the argument that to see the working
class as central, crucial, to any possible socialist future is arbitrarily
to privilege it; that every kind of oppressed subject or social identity is a
potential agency of socialism quite equally with this one? If the argument
exploits a notion of socialism as, definitionally, only that kind of society from
which all forms of social oppression have been removed, then socialism has
been redefined again as universal, all-encompassing goal, and the whole point of
insisting on its specificity and its distinction from other goals is lost. One
might just as well say that the working class, or ethnic minorities, are
equal potential agencies with women for overcoming gender oppression -
understood, this, as the end of all oppressions. To establish, in other words, an
equality amongst various putative agencies of socialism, the current critiques
of Marxism on this point have quietly to take back what they forthrightly -
and justly - put forward concerning the non-comprehensive, the particular,
nature of the aim of a classless society.</p><p>If, on the other hand, this is not taken back, then the argument against
&lsquo;privileging? the working class as agency of socialism, or that to do so is
undemocratic, is unconvincing. Across the variety of conceptions of what is
socialism, a core idea has always been the removal of that form of economic
exploitation which is associated with class division. Cutting through the
thorny issue of the boundaries of the working class, we say it is composed
roughly of all the victims - organized and not, male and female, black or
white, ethnically diverse, and of whatever sexual orientation - of economic
exploitation, then there are at least two good reasons to suppose that it is
this constituency that is the primary constituency of socialism.</p><p>First, it has an interest (Hindess notwithstanding) in opposing capitalist
exploitation, in a way that alternative constituencies, alternatively defined,
do not. Women, just as women, for example, do not; unless it can be shown
persuasively that the significantly wealthy among them, by birth, or by
marriage, or by professional or commercial success, are in their generality
just as likely to come to a consciousness of the injustices of capitalism as
are women workers; or unless it can be shown persuasively why the struggle
against gender inequality is, just as such, intrinsically anti-capitalist, and
consequently socialist. Apart from restoring, once again, the sort of spurious
universalism that is criticized in traditionally inflated socialist claims,
this amounts to saying - as has been said rather too often, wrongly - that
capitalism by its very nature-could not-accommodate or adapt to this or that
particular democratic goal. Who will confidently say it about either gender-or
ethnic quality? What in the nature of capitalism definitively forbids the one
or the other? Capitalism, as Marxists are all too frequently lectured, is not
the cause of all ills. And it is not at all clear that to fight to remove these
of them from existing capitalist societies must be to fight in vain.</p><p>Second, the idea - considered normatively now rather than predictively - that
exactly those on the receiving end of a given form of oppression or injustice
might be the primary agents of its liquidation is the opposite of
undemocratic. It is a rather old idea and scarcely exclusive to Marxism: that
genuine social liberations are not (as a rule at any rate) delivered to people by
someone else. Within Marxism this theme has had the name of
proletarian self-emancipation, and the problem with it has often been seen to
be, not the theme itself, but that no Marxists have really taken it seriously
(as, unhappily, many Marxists have not), going in for various, elitist
substitutions. Of a sudden, it turns out that it is the sentiment itself
that is at fault, underwriting a kind of privilege. Quite how far things have
gone today in the development of facile criticisms of Marxism across a sector
of the Left may be gauged by imagining what the reaction would be, were a
parallel of this &lsquo;privileging&rsquo; argument to be tried out in relation to some
other type of oppression. If someone were to suggest, for instance, that one
should not specially focus on 1 women as the primary constituency of the battle
against women&rsquo;s oppression; or that black people in South Africa had no
privileged (!) place in the current &lsquo;struggle against apartheid - it is a safe
bet there would be many who would even cross the road to respond to the
suggestion.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>This critical commentary was composed, though all the material engaged and
criticized by it predates the period, in the months spanning the turn into
the 19905, when momentous events, far from played out, were unfolding in
Eastern Europe. Whatever other consequences may follow upon these events, it
seems not improbable that one consequence will be a further impetus to the
propagation of material of a similar kind. Already it is possible to detect,
within the spectrum of early reactions, one that might be called retrospective
Stalinism or at least Brezhnevism: by which I mean a tendency, amongst people
who have thought, insisted, for years that the Soviet and Eastern European
regimes were not a genuine embodiment or product of Marxist belief, to
wonder if the entire tradition is not now bankrupted by their wreckage - as
though the ideas and values of Marxism were then, after all, wrapped up in
these regimes, as before they were said not to be.</p><p>The sense in which it is likely to be true that a tradition is ended, is that
the time of mass-based socialist movements which conceived themselves as
specifically Marxist may well be up. There are good reasons, as well as bad
ones, for drawing a line under it. Any socialist movement that seeks now to
define itself by reference to one label or doctrine, that does not contain at
its heart a vigorous, committed pluralism, intellectual and political, is
doomed to be, not a movement, but a sect. At the same time, if socialism has
any 1 future, the movement for it needs to know where it has come from, not
only the resources it lacks, but also the ones it has. It needs a proper form
of self-accounting. Making a mess of its own past, of the different strands
or currents within it, will not be a rewarding procedure. And this is to say
nothing, all politics of the thing set aside, of the elementary care and
sense of proportion which each generation of thinkers owes to the efforts of
generations of thinkers before it.</p><h2 id=notes>Notes</h2><ol start=23><li></li></ol><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>See John Keane. <em>Democracv and Civil Society</em>. London 1988. DD. 54.63: for

Those interested in the debate on &rsquo;essential
contestability&rsquo; may consult here also a small new contribution to it. The view
of democracy which Keane defends &lsquo;acknowledges its essentially contested
quality&rsquo;. But then that view - &lsquo;a pluralist civil society guarded by an open
and accountable state&rsquo; - is at once said to comprehend that what is seen as
democratic &lsquo;at any given time and place can be maintained&mldr;only through
