purport to provide an alternative to orthodox or monetarist
ideas without drastically changing the constitutional
framework. They offer proposals for a programme of
expansion and redistribution of income, involving gradual
changes in the structure of the economy, to provide the
possibility of durable and stable growth. They oppose
deflationary policies of the IMF variety on the grounds
that they hurt the poorer sections of the population and
that they inhibit growth and the restructuring of the
economy. It is arguable that the Fret government was
trying to apply these ideas in its first two or three years in
office (1964-7). It appeared that it might have found a
middle way in economics, as in politics, between stagnation
and revolution. Its economic policies had some unorthodox
features which at first seemed to be rather successful. The
fact that their success was short-lived may possibly prove
that the international agencies are, in one sense, right, there
is no painless way of solving Chile&rsquo;s economic problems,
without somebody&rsquo;s interests being hurt. The question, of
course, is whose interests are hurt.</p><p>Inflation in Chile had been more or less continuous since
the end of the nineteenth century. After the Second World
War, stabilization programmers of the orthodox variety were tried on several
occasions, with impermanent effects in 1963 and 1964 the Alessandri government
was attempting to control inflation with the help of stand-by agreements with
the IMF and programme loans from the AID, which on this occasion provided the
main pressure for stabilization. Chile ran big balance of payments deficits
and its foreign debt rose rapidly. Alessandri&rsquo;s strategy was to borrow from
abroad and pay for this out of the growth it was hoped to generate. Apart from
this, efforts were concentrated on keeping wage and salary increases below
the rise in the cost of living and on limiting government expenditure;
admittedly they were not very successful efforts. At any rate, in 1963 and 1964
growth was barely equal to the= population increase, the rate of inflation
in 1964 was 38 per cent.</p><p>The Frei government came into office in September 1964. The economic authorities, and especially the Finance Minister Molina, had
clear views on policy. Their control and knowledge of the economy was
more effective and sophisticated than under the previous government. Their
economic programme had several structuralist features. The most important
general principle of the programme was the intention simultaneously to
achieve three objectives: to slow down inflation, to increase the rate of
growth and to redistribute income in a progressive direction. The government&rsquo;s
emphasis on agrarian reform reflected these objectives. They were considered
not to be alternatives, as monetarists might argue, but conditions of one
another, both for political and for economic reasons.</p><p>The government was concerned as a major objective with
the elimination of inflation. It was not prepared to try to
achieve stabilization in the short run. The authorities conceded that it would be technically possible to achieve
stabilization without growth, but from the political point of
view it was considered impossible. And from the economic
point of view, it was felt that the results were unlikely to be
maintained: as soon as growth began again, all the old
problems would recur, basically because nothing had been
done to ensure that supply would be any more likely to keep
up with demand than it had in the past. The Government
claimed that it was attacking not merely the symptoms but
also the &lsquo;fundamental causes of inflation&rsquo;. In other words
It was tackling the failure of the economy to grow, and in
particular the stagnation of agriculture and the difficulty in
expanding Chile&rsquo;s exports.</p><p>The authorities also agreed with the monetarist point of
view to the extent of believing that stabilization programmes
in the past had failed partly because governments had been
politically unable to carry them through. Thus part of the
sophistication of their policy was that they calculated rather
carefully where the burden of readjustment was to fall. This was done by compensating workers for rises in agricultural
prices by a fairly liberal wages policy, and devaluing the
escudo by monthly adjustments, slowly at first, thus to some
extent avoiding the all-round price increases which had
usually followed devaluation in the past.</p><p>As far as growth was concerned, the government decided
to concentrate as an immediate objective on an expansion
in copper production and exports. Successive Chilean
governments had tried, through incentives such as tax
reductions and devaluation, to get the US copper companies
to produce and export more. The Frei government made an
agreement with the copper companies under which they
were to double production by 1970, it undertook to provide
most of the capital, and obtained a loan for this purpose
from the US Export-Import Bank. Other industrial projects
were supported through the State-owned CORFO:
petro-chemicals, paper, a sugar refinery, cellulose. In
addition government expenditure, both current and investment, expanded considerably, particularly in education ,
although there were also big tax increases, the budgetary
deficit at first increased. The industrial sector, which had
much unutilized capacity, apparently was able to expand
production to meet the increase in demand and the shift in
its pattern, some producers of mass-consumption goods in
particular increased their overall profits, in spite of bigger
wage and tax bills and reasonably effective price controls,
as a result of a bigger volume of sales.</p><p>A major policy of the Frei government was land reform. Like other policies in
the government&rsquo;s programme, it was supposed to serve several purposes &mdash;
anti-inflationary, productive, redistributive and social, According to
structuralist theories one of the main causes of iodation is the slow growth
of food supplies. Chilean agriculture is inefficient, and a number of large
farms are under-utilized. It was considered that changes in the system of
land tenure would not only improve material and social conditions for the
rural poor but also increase production, in many cases immediately. It seems
that production on the land expropriated in the first years of the Fret
government did in fact increase, although the government was not particularly
successful in expanding the general level of agricultural production. On
farms which were not expropriated, output also sometimes rose, since their
owners hoped to escape expropriation in this way, although there appears also
to have been some precautionary disinvestment. The government&rsquo;s land-reform
law, which was held up in Congress for over two years, made expropriation
somewhat easier and the terms for landlords somewhat less favorable.</p><p>In addition, the government had a number of other
policies of a social and redistributory nature. As has been
said, the government&rsquo;s expenditure, current as well as
investment, increased considerably. The land-reform law
allowed peasants to organize themselves in trade unions,
which had previously been banned. The minimum wage in
rural areas was raised. Educational programmes were expanded and reformed, It was claimed that, with its programme of &lsquo;promocion popular&rsquo;, the government was laying
the foundation for a &lsquo;communitarian&rsquo; form of society.
Unemployment was reduced. In general, the government&rsquo;s
fiscal policies, its policies on wages and prices, and its
success in reducing unemployment, constituted
what the IMF described as &lsquo;a sharp redistribution of income&rsquo;, and
the redistribution in fact went further than had been planned.</p><p>All this did amount to considerable innovation along
what might be described as structuralist lines. In the First
two years it also seemed a rather triumphant vindication of
structuralist arguments on growth and inflation. Chile
achieved the hat-trick: more growth, less iodation, and
some progressive redistribution of income. In 1965 the rate
of growth was 5 per cent and the rate of inflation was down To 26 per cent. In 1966, growth was 7 per cent, inflation 17
per cent. In 1967, inflation was planned to be 10 percent.
Chile also greatly improved its balance of payments
position; in 1966 it had a record balance of payments
surplus of $100 million Commercial arrears were paid off;
the proportion of short-term high interest debt in Chile&rsquo;s
total foreign debt declined considerably. For 1967 the
government was able to decide to do without the AID
programme loan and the IMF stand-by.</p><p>But much of this success was made possible by high copper prices. In 1965,
copper prices increased by II per cent, which accounted for most of the export
increase of 15 per cent, in 1966 copper prices increased by 25 per cent, total
exports by a third. The share of copper in Child&rsquo;s total exports increased from
60 per cent in 1964 to nearly 70 per cent in 1966. Increases in copper prices
are said to have accounted for half the increase in tax receipts. The
government maintained that it could have adjusted its programme to a lower
level of copper prices without distorting it, and that it would, in any case,
have been possible to obtain aid in comparable amounts if copper prices had not
risen. But the fact that copper prices fell in 1967, although they were still
high, must be at least partly responsible for the governments failure to
continue the slowing down of inflation in 1967 and 1968. It also of course contributes to the force of one of the structuralists&rsquo; main arguments: that the
difficulties of developing countries are to a considerable extent caused by
fluctuations in their export prices and deterioration, especially during the
1950s, in their terms of trade.</p><p>More serious perhaps from a theoretical point of view is that the Chilean
government, like other governments trying to achieve stabilization, quite
rapidly found itself faced with the difficulty of increasing investment. By
1967, existing capacity in the private sector was being fully used and new
investment was needed for expansion. The limits in taxation had, in the
governments view, been reached or possibly exceeded. There were some who felt
that taxation must be reduced in order to allow the private sector to invest.
The government resorted to a highly controversial alternative: wage-earners,
instead of receiving their full wage adjustment in cash in proportion to the
rise in the cost of living, were to receive part of it in the form of ends
conferring ownership in new industries to be set up by the government. The
government claimed that, faced with the alternatives of a reduction in the
level of investment or a reduction in the level of taxation of the private
sector, it had adopted a solution that would reduce the concentration of
industrial power, the proposal could in fact be interpreted as quite radical,
leading to workers&rsquo; ownership of state industries. But it was strongly attacked
by the left, who saw it as undermining the standards of living of the workers
and felt that the bonds were likely to become worthless. The policy had to be
abandoned amid political crisis, rather like IMF policies before it. Since, in
an effort to prevent the increase in the rate of inflation, the government also
decided on restrictions in government expenditure and in the expansion of
credit in 1968, many of the expansionist aspects of the government&rsquo;s economic
policies were abandoned.</p><p>In general, it could be argued that the government&rsquo;s policies were too
cautious, and they were quite unrevolutionary. This is particularly apparent in
the case of the two major planks of the government&rsquo;s political programme:
&lsquo;Chileanization&rsquo; of the copper companies, and land reform. As far as the copper
companies were concerned, the government, like other governments before it,
made big concessions to the copper companies in order to get them to agree to
expand their production.. The companies got a large reduction in their rate of
taxation. &lsquo;Chileanization&rsquo; meant basically that the Chilean government put up
most of the capital for expansion. In one case it bought a majority share in a
compares capital, but acquired comparatively little management control. The
copper companies were delighted with the arrangement. From an economic point
of view Chile would almost certainly have gained if the companies had simply
been nationalized. After their long and fruitful exploitation of Chile&rsquo;s
mineral resources, and with Chile&rsquo;s almost total dependence on their
activities, the copper companies no doubt know that they will, one day, be
nationalized. As an interim arrangement, the Frei government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Chileanization&rsquo;
is a great boon.</p><p>The land reform programme originally aimed at the settling of 100,000 families
on expropriated land by 1970. This would have been about 40 per cent of the
existing landless population. Partly because it was over two years before the
government&rsquo;s new law was passed by Congress, the programme was slow in
starting. By 1967, about 5,000 families had been settled. It became clear that
the target would be reduced. The main justification used for reducing it was
that the programme would be too expensive. About a third of the cost was for
compensation of land-owners, although much of this was in fixed-term bonds,
and therefore involved an element of expropriation, it could be argued that
it was further compressible. The rest was for new housing and roads, machinery,
working capital, education and research. The government was determined that the
programme should be thorough and that great efforts should be made to avoid a
drop in production. But it is possible that part of its determination arose
from the fact that it underestimated the capabilities of Chilean peasants, and
that it failed to distinguish between what was essential and what, like
government housing, was not. Possibly the government&rsquo;s determination also
arose from the fact that the Cabinet, most of whom were land-owners, had their
own reasons for time-consuming thoroughness. Moreover, when land is
transferred there is likely to be some fall in production on some farms, and
certainly some increase in local consumption, however cautious the programme, before the undeniable and undenied long-term benefits of land reform
are translated into higher marketed production. Other things being equal,
therefore, the sooner the land is transferred, the sooner these benefits are
likely to materialize. Also, if the period of transfer is short, one of the
arguments advanced by the critics of land reform, that uncertainty about
ownership causes land-owners not to invest, disappears.</p><p>What of the attitude of the international agencies? First
it should be said that it is clear that one of the reasons
why the copper companies, at least, were not nationalized,
and why the Christian Democrats were elected rather than
the FRAP, the Communist-Socialist coalition committed
to nationalization, was fear of" the United States. Before the
1964 election, the Christian Democrats had come to an
understanding with the United States government on
various issues, including treatment of the copper companies. This was one reason why the United States decided
to back them. In the absence of such an agreement, or had
the Christian Democrats been defeated by the FRAP, the
United States would have had various nears of retaliation
at its disposal. The economic ones might not have been
decisive. Forgoing aid and foreign private investment,
nationalizing United States assets, and defaulting on debts
could have had major economic advantages for Chile, and
would presumably not have led to the loss of the 85 per cent
of Chile&rsquo;s markets for copper which are in Europe. But it
was clear that the United States would have gone, and still
would go, to considerable lengths, including possibly
military intervention, perhaps through the intermediary of
the Chilean army or of other Latin-American governments,
to prevent a party or coalition committed to nationalization
and radical social changes from winning the elections, or,
if it did, from taking office, or at least from putting its
policies into effect.</p><p>Once the Christian Democrats were elected, with their commitment to &lsquo;revolution
in liberty", the IMF and the AID were again involved. A Chilean mission went to
Washington to negotiate a new standby with the IMF. A programme loan was
negotiated with the AID. A rescheduling of Chile&rsquo;s debts was arranged, mainly
on the insistence of the United States government. The World Bank was not
directly involved in negotiations of Chile&rsquo;s general economic policies during
this period, although it made a large loan for electric power in 1966, but it
too expressed its views on Chilean policies and, its mission in Chile in 1966
wrote a general report.</p><p>The attitude of the international agencies to the Fret governments economic
programme was interesting. It consisted mainly in trying to ensure that Chilean
policies were &lsquo;consistent&rsquo; with one another. A US State Department view was
that the Chileans had a confused set of policies which were not internally
consistent, and that programme loan negotiations in the first year had forced
Chile to reconcile the conflicting objectives of simultaneous income
redistribution and reduction in inflation. There appeared to he very little
recognition of, or willingness to discuss, the theories behind Chilean
policies, particularly the theory that the government&rsquo;s objectives, far from
being &lsquo;inconsistent&rsquo; or were in fact conditional on one another. A notable
exception to this failure of understanding was in the AID mission in Chile,
where, at least in one case, there was considerable sympathy with and
understanding for Chilean economic and social objectives. Elsewhere officials
were prepared to admit, at most, that the Chilean authorities, with strong
leftwing opposition, were justified in their concern with political support.
There was also some recognition of practical successes. The IMF&rsquo;s 1967 Annual
Report, for instance, began with a laudatory paragraph on Chile&rsquo;s achievement
of faster growth, slower inflation, improvement in the balance of payments and
sharp redistribution of income. The AID was of course prepared to admire some
of the government&rsquo;s social policies per se. The World Bank&rsquo;s report was more
negative.</p><p>At any rate, the IMF and the AID decided, with reasons, to give full financial
backing to the government&rsquo;s programme. The United States had essential
political reasons for supporting the Christian Democrats, whatever their
policies. In so far as the IMF and some US officials praised the government&rsquo;s
initial economic successes, they tended to ascribe these to what was felt to be
a more vigorous application of the kinds of anti-inflationary policies which
the two agencies had rather unsuccessfully been trying to persuade the
Alessandri government to adopt. The AID was particularly pleased by, and
apparently felt with very dubious justification responsible for, the
government&rsquo;s achievement in increasing tax revenues and reforming the budget.
The IMF was encouraged by some relaxation and simplification of import and
exchange controls, and by the considerable reduction in the rate of overall
credit expansions Both in the IMF and in the AID there was praise for
improvement in the techniques of monetary control. But there is little doubt
that they also accepted aspects of the programme of which they disapproved, or
at any rate which they would not themselves have recommended. The Chileans, in
their presentation of their policies, played down some of their more unorthodox
aspects and stressed their concern with controlling inflation, but they had at
least to get acceptance for the notion that the control of inflation should be
&lsquo;gradual&rsquo;</p><p>As far as criticism was concerned the main pressure in the
reports, advice and negotiations of the three international
agencies was on controlling public expenditure, especially expenditure for social purposes, and on controlling wage increases. The IMF considered that the gradual control of
initiation must necessarily involve &lsquo;increasingly tighter
overall financial programmes year after year&rsquo;. It also felt
that the policy of income redistribution must be moderated
if business savings were to be promoted. In the World
Bank there was concern that the public sector was &lsquo;getting
too large a share of the cake&rsquo;. The international agencies
solution for the problem of investment was therefore that
taxation should be reduced, and they felt that the government&rsquo;s efforts to tax the private sector had gone too far. All three institutions were especially disturbed by the size of
the government&rsquo;s housing programme: the AID, it should
be said, felt that the governments expenditure should be
reoriented towards agriculture and other directly productive
purposes, the IMF and the World Bank pressed for general
limitation on the increase in public expenditure, and were
alarmed that the budget deficit had not been reduced in the
government&rsquo;s first year.</p><p>Above all, both the World Bank and the IMF came down strongly on the side of
reducing the target for land reform, suggesting 20,000 or 30,000 families as
more suitable targets. Their main reason for doing so was that they considered
the programme would be too expensive. The World Bank, indeed, on whose 1966
mission there were agricultural specialists, was of the opinion that the cost
per family would be even higher than the Chileans had estimated international
officials were also concerned &lsquo;about the short-term effects of land reform on
production, the perspective in the World Bank was &rsquo;the next four or five
years&rsquo;. Some still felt that higher prices were the solution for Chilean
agriculture. At any rate, the decisions of the IMF and the World Bank on land
reform were taken on the basis of its effect on public finances and of its
short term effects on production. From both these points of view it was felt,
rightly or wrongly that land reform was undesirable, and it was therefore
discouraged. Even though it was recognized at a responsible level in the World
Bank that Chile&rsquo;s agricultural development in the long term was dependent on
its basic social conflicts being resolved, it was nevertheless felt that
Chile &lsquo;simply could not afford&rsquo; a land-reform programme of the size proposed.
As for the AID, its official attitude was fairly neutral, in the State
Department it was claimed that the US &lsquo;certainly did not hold up land reform.</p><p>For 1967 the Chilean government decided to do without an IMF stand-by and AID
programme loan. This does not seem to have been because it wanted to avoid the
conditions attached to them. Negotiations with the AID for a programme loan
were in fact practically concluded; the Chileans told the AID they would carry
out the agreed programme, and announced publicly that the loan would still be
available if, for instance, copper prices fell. Similarly they assured the
IMF that their decision to forgo the stand-by should not be interpreted as an
unwillingness to formulate financial and general economic policies within the
framework of an internally consistent programme. It seems there were several
reasons for deciding to do without the financial support of the two agencies.
One was political, it was useful to demonstrate that the government was not
wholly dependent on external support. There was also doubtless a desire to
reduce this dependence in fact, Chile&rsquo;s heavy foreign indebtedness was an
obvious limitation on its freedom of manoeuvre, so long of course as it
hoped for further credit in the future and was not prepared to take the
drastic step of defaulting on its debts. There were in addition various
practical reasons: at a time when there was a boom Io foreign trade, there
were strong pressures on the government to start new projects and to
increase wages, especially in the copper industry, and the government wanted
to put itself in a better position to resist these pressures by appealing
to a patriotic desire to reduce foreign dependence. Finally of course it
would have been difficult simply to put the AID loan into the reserves.</p><p>The Chilean economic authorities were not particularly bothered by the efforts
of the international agencies to influence their policies. They tended to say
that these efforts did no harm, and might even help in Chile&rsquo;s case where the
authorities had a clear programme of their own which in fact they persuaded the
agencies to support. They felt that in countries whose economic policies were
not so clearly formulated the pressure could be more damaging. Besides,
policies which the agencies supported such as reducing the budget deficit,
controlling wage increases and improving the management of monetary policy,
were policies with which the authorities were in any case concerned. Those
policies of a more expansionist or redistributory nature, which on the whole
the international agencies opposed, were carried out in spite of them. Some
Chileans felt not that the international agencies approved of Chilean policies,
but that, in the political situation immediately after the elections, the
international agencies &lsquo;would have supported anything&rsquo;; the programme was
&lsquo;approved&rsquo; reluctantly, but the agencies were later, on the whole, convinced by
its success. As far as taxes were concerned, it was felt in one case that AID
support might have had a beneficial effect in the sense that the opponents of
increases in taxation could no longer expect support from the United States
the US position was described as &lsquo;a sort of green light&rsquo; for taxation, and even
for land reform.</p><p>It was also felt by at least one Chilean official that the discussions were
useful in the sense that they enabled the Chilean authorities to clarify their
ideas. Some who were concerned with excesses in certain lands of public
expenditure and in wage increases felt that their position was reinforced. The
Chilean authorities also felt that the IMF and the AID were changing slowly
and incoherently when asked whether international officials were capable of
understanding what the Chileans were trying to do, one answer was that the
quality of AID economists had gone up sharply, and they could now make a real
intellectual contribution. IMF officials apparently varied; of some of those
who came to Chile, the Chileans might afterwards be able to say: &rsquo;that was a
good one, he understood.&rsquo;</p><p>In any case, the differences between the Chilean economic authorities and the
international agencies were not really fundamental. There were differences of
emphasis, differences of method, and differences of understanding. But the
ultimate goals were similar: both the government and the international agencies
were basically in favour of financial stability, growth, a more equal
distribution of income, legality and evolutionary change. The government hoped
to achieve them all at once, the international agencies said Chile must choose
between them, and tried to persuade the government to put stability and
legality first. Whether, given even more political skill and determination,
the Frei government could have achieved all its goals at once is doubtful. At
any rate when the crunch came Chile seems to have abandoned many of its
expansionist and reformist goals, and to have come down on the side of the
international agencies.</p></p></div><div class=page-footer><hr class=footer-divider><a class=tag href=/tags/imperialism>#imperialism</a>
