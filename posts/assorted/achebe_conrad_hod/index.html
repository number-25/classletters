It was a fine
autumn morning such as encouraged friendliness to passing strangers. Brisk
youngsters were hurrying in all directions, many of them obviously freshmen in their first flush of enthusiasm.An older man going the same way as I
turned and remarked to me how very young they came these days. I agreed.
Then he asked me if I was a student too. I said, no, I was a teacher.What did
I teach? African literature. Now that was funny, he said, because he knew a
fellow who taught the same thing, or perhaps it was African <em>history</em>, in a certain community college not far from here. It always surprised him, he went
on to say, because he never had thought of Africa as having that kind of
stuff, you know. By this time I was walking much faster. “Oh well,” I heard
him say finally, behind me: “I guess I have to take your course to find out.”</p><p>A few weeks later I received two very touching letters from high
school children in Yonkers, New York, who — bless their teacher — had
just read <em>Things Fall Apart</em>. One of them was particularly happy to learn
about the customs and superstitions of an African tribe.</p><p>I propose to draw from these rather trivial encounters rather heavy
conclusions which at first sight might seem somewhat out of proportion
to them. But only, I hope, at first sight.</p><p>The young fellow from Yonkers, perhaps partly on account of his age,
but I believe also for much deeper and more serious reasons, is obviously
unaware that the life of his own tribesmen in Yonkers, New York, is full
of odd customs and superstitions and, like everybody else in his culture,
imagines that he needs a trip to Africa to encounter those things.</p><p>The other person being fully my own age could not be excused on the
grounds of his years. Ignorance might be a more likely reason; but here
again I believe that something more wilful than a mere lack of information was at work. For did not that erudite British historian and Regius
Professor at Oxford, Hugh Trevor-Roper, also pronounce that African
history did not exist?</p><p>If there is something in these utterances more than youthful inexperience, more than a lack of factual knowledge, what is it? Quite simply it
is the desire — one might indeed say the need — in Western psychology
to set Africa up as a foil to Europe, as a place of negations at once remote
and vaguely familiar, in comparison with which Europe’s own state of
spiritual grace will be manifest.</p><p>This need is not new; which should relieve us all of considerable responsibility and perhaps make us even willing to look at this phenomenon
dispassionately. I have neither the wish nor the competence to embark on
the exercise with the tools of the social and biological sciences but do so
more simply in the manner of a novelist responding to the famous book of
European fiction: Joseph Conrad’s <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, which better than any
other work that I know displays that Western desire and need which I have
just referred to. Of course there are whole libraries of books devoted to the
same purpose but most of them are so obvious and so crude that few
people worry about them today. Conrad, on the other hand, is undoubtedly one of the great stylists of modern fiction and a good storyteller into
the bargain. His contribution therefore falls automatically into a different
class — permanent literature — read and taught and constantly evaluated by
serious academics. <em>Heart of Darkness</em> is indeed so secure today that a leading
Conrad scholar has numbered it “among the half-dozen greatest short
novels in the English language.”<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> I will return to this critical opinion in due
course because it may seriously modify my earlier suppositions about who
may or may not be guilty in some of the matters I will now raise.</p><p><em>Heart of Darkness</em> projects the image of Africa as “the other world,” the
antithesis of Europe and therefore of civilization, a place where man’s
vaunted intelligence and refinement are finally mocked by triumphant
bestiality. The book opens on the River Thames, tranquil, resting peacefully “at the decline of day after ages of good service done to the race
that peopled its banks.”<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> But the actual story will take place on the River
Congo, the very antithesis of the Thames. The River Congo is quite decidedly not a River Emeritus. It has rendered no service and enjoys no
old-age pension.We are told that “going up that river was travelling back
to the earliest beginning of the world.”</p><p>Is Conrad saying then that these two rivers are very different, one good,
the other bad? Yes, but that is not the real point. It is not the differentness
that worries Conrad but the lurking hint of kinship, of common ancestry. For the Thames too “has been one of the dark places of the earth.”
It conquered its darkness, of course, and is now in daylight and at peace.</p><p>But if it were to visit its primordial relative, the Congo, it would run the
terrible risk of hearing grotesque echoes of its own forgotten darkness,
and falling victim to an avenging recrudescence of the mindless frenzy of
the first beginnings.</p><p>These suggestive echoes comprise Conrad’s famed evocation of the
African atmosphere in <em>Heart of Darkness</em>. In the final consideration, his
method amounts to no more than a steady, ponderous, fake-ritualistic
repetition of two antithetical sentences, one about silence and the other
about frenzy. We can inspect samples of this on pages 103 and 105 of
the New American Library edition: (a) “It was the stillness of an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable intention” and (b) “The steamer
toiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy.”
Of course, there is a judicious change of adjective from time to time, so
that instead of “inscrutable,” for example, you might have “unspeakable,”
even plain “mysterious,” etc., etc.</p><p>The eagle-eyed English critic F. R. Leavis<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> drew attention long ago to
Conrad’s “adjectival insistence upon inexpressible and incomprehensible
mystery.” That insistence must not be dismissed lightly, as many Conrad
critics have tended to do, as a mere stylistic flaw; for it raises serious
questions of artistic good faith. When a writer while pretending to record scenes, incidents, and their impact is in reality engaged in inducing
hypnotic stupor in his readers through a bombardment of emotive words
and other forms of trickery, much more has to be at stake than stylistic
felicity. Generally, normal readers are well armed to detect and resist such
underhand activity. But Conrad chose his subject well — one which was
guaranteed not to put him in conflict with the psychological predisposition of his readers or raise the need for him to contend with their resistance. He chose the role of purveyor of comforting myths.</p><p>The most interesting and revealing passages in <em>Heart of Darkness</em> are,
however, about people. I must crave the indulgence of my reader to
quote almost a whole page from about the middle of the story, when
representatives of Europe in a steamer going down the Congo encounter
the denizens of Africa:</p><blockquote><p>We were wanderers on a prehistoric earth, on an earth that wore
the aspect of an unknown planet. We could have fancied ourselves
the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance, to be
subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil. But
suddenly, as we struggled round a bend, there would be a glimpse of
rush walls, of peaked grass-roofs, a burst of yells, a whirl of black limbs, a mass of hands clapping, of feet stamping, of bodies swaying, of eyes
rolling, under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage. The steamer
toiled along slowly on the edge of the black and incomprehensible
frenzy. The prehistoric man was cursing us, praying to us, welcoming us — who could tell? We were cut off from the comprehension
of our surroundings; we glided past like phantoms, wondering and
secretly appalled, as sane men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse. We could not understand because we were too
far and could not remember because we were travelling in the night
of first ages, of those ages that are gone, leaving hardly a sign — and
no memories.
The earth seemed unearthly. We are accustomed to look upon the
shackled form of a conquered monster, but there — there you could
look at a thing monstrous and free. It was unearthly, and the men
were — No, they were not inhuman. Well, you know, that was the
worst of it — this suspicion of their not being inhuman. It would come
slowly to one. They howled and leaped, and spun, and made horrid
faces; but what thrilled you was just the thought of their humanity — like yours — the thought of your remote kinship with this wild
and passionate uproar. Ugly. Yes, it was ugly enough; but if you were
man enough you would admit to yourself that there was in you just
the faintest trace of a response to the terrible frankness of that noise,
a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it which you — you so
remote from the night of first ages — could comprehend.<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Herein lies the meaning of <em>Heart of Darkness</em> and the fascination it
holds over the Western mind: “What thrilled you was just the thought of
their humanity — like yours&mldr; Ugly.”</p><p>Having shown us Africa in the mass, Conrad then zeros in, half a page
later, on a specific example, giving us one of his rare descriptions of an
African who is not just limbs or rolling eyes:</p><blockquote><p>And between whiles I had to look after the savage who was fireman.
He was an improved specimen; he could fire up a vertical boiler. He
was there below me, and, upon my word, to look at him was as edifying as seeing a dog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat, walking
on his hind legs. A few months of training had done for that really
fine chap. He squinted at the steam gauge and at the water gauge with
an evident effort of intrepidity — and he had filed his teeth, too, the
poor devil, and the wool of his pate shaved into queer patterns, and
three ornamental scars on each of his cheeks. He ought to have been
clapping his hands and stamping his feet on the bank, instead of which
he was hard at work, a thrall to strange witchcraft, full of improving
knowledge.<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>As everybody knows, Conrad is a romantic on the side. He might
not exactly admire savages clapping their hands and stamping their feet,
but they have at least the merit of being in their place, unlike this dog
in a parody of breeches. For Conrad, things being in their place is of the
utmost importance.</p><p>“Fine fellows — cannibals — in their place,” he tells us pointedly.Tragedy begins when things leave their accustomed place, like Europe leaving
its safe stronghold between the policeman and the baker to take a peep
into the heart of darkness.</p><p>Before the story takes us into the Congo basin proper we are given
this nice little vignette as an example of things in their place:</p><blockquote><p>Now and then a boat from the shore gave one a momentary contact
with reality. It was paddled by black fellows. You could see from afar
the white of their eyeballs glistening. They shouted, sang, their bodies
streamed with perspiration; they had faces like grotesque masks — these
chaps; but they had bone, muscle, a wild vitality, an intense energy of
movement, that was as natural and true as the surf along their coast.They
wanted no excuse for being there.They were a great comfort to look at.<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Towards the end of the story Conrad lavishes a whole page quite
unexpectedly on an African woman who has obviously been some kind
of mistress to Mr. Kurtz and now presides (if I may be permitted a little
liberty) like a formidable mystery over the inexorable imminence of his
departure:</p><blockquote><p>She was savage and superb, wild-eyed and magnificent . . . . She stood
looking at us without a stir and like the wilderness itself, with an air
of brooding over an inscrutable purpose.</p></blockquote><p>This Amazon is drawn in considerable details, albeit of a predictable
nature, for two reasons. First, she is in her place and so can win Conrad’s
special brand of approval; and second, she fulfills a structural requirement
of the story; a savage counterpart to the refined, European woman who
will step forth to end the story:</p><blockquote><p>She came forward, all in black with a pale head, floating toward me in
the dusk. She was in mourning&mldr; She took both my hands in hers
and murmured, “I had heard you were coming.”&mldr; She had a mature
capacity for fidelity, for belief, for suffering.<sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>The difference in the attitude of the novelist to these two women is
conveyed in too many direct and subtle ways to need elaboration. But
perhaps the most significant difference is the one implied in the author’s
bestowal of human expression to the one and the withholding of it from
the other. It is clearly not part of Conrad’s purpose to confer language
on the “rudimentary souls” of Africa. In place of speech they made “a
violent babble of uncouth sounds.” They “exchanged short grunting
phrases” even among themselves. But most of the time they were too
busy with their frenzy. There are two occasions in the book, however,
when Conrad departs somewhat from his practice and confers speech,
even English speech, on the savages. The first occurs when cannibalism
gets the better of them:</p><blockquote><p>“Catch ’im,” he snapped, with a bloodshot widening of his eyes and a
flash of sharp white teeth —“catch ’im. Give ’im to us.” “To you, eh?”
I asked; “what would you do with them?” “Eat ’im!” he said curtly.<sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>The other occasion was the famous announcement: “Mistah Kurtz —
he dead.”<sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup></p><p>At first sight these instances might be mistaken for unexpected acts of
generosity from Conrad. In reality they constitute some of his best assaults. In the case of the cannibals the incomprehensible grunts that had
thus far served them for speech suddenly proved inadequate for Conrad’s purpose of letting the European glimpse the unspeakable craving in
their hearts.Weighing the necessity for consistency in the portrayal of the
dumb brutes against the sensational advantages of securing their conviction by clear, unambiguous evidence issuing out of their own mouths,
Conrad chose the latter. As for the announcement of Mr. Kurtz’s death
by the “insolent black head in the doorway,” what better or more appropriate <em>finis</em> could be written to the horror story of that wayward child of
civilization who wilfully had given his soul to the powers of darkness and
“taken a high seat amongst the devils of the land” than the proclamation
of his physical death by the forces he had joined?</p><p>It might be contended, of course, that the attitude to the African in
<em>Heart of Darkness</em> is not Conrad’s but that of his fictional narrator, Marlow, and that far from endorsing it Conrad might indeed be holding it
up to irony and criticism. Certainly, Conrad appears to go to considerable pains to set up layers of insulation between himself and the moral
universe of his story. He has, for example, a narrator behind a narrator.
The primary narrator is Marlow, but his account is given to us through the filter of a second, shadowy person. But if Conrad’s intention is to
draw a cordon sanitaire between himself and the moral and psychological <em>malaise</em> of his narrator, his care seems to me totally wasted because he neglects to hint, clearly and adequately, at an alternative frame
of reference by which we may judge the actions and opinions of his
characters. It would not have been beyond Conrad’s power to make
that provision if he had thought it necessary. Conrad seems to me to
approve of Marlow, with only minor reservations — a fact reinforced by
the similarities between their two careers.</p><p>Marlow comes through to us not only as a witness of truth, but one
holding those advanced and humane views appropriate to the English
liberal tradition which required all Englishmen of decency to be deeply
shocked by atrocities in Bulgaria or the Congo of King Leopold of the
Belgians or wherever.</p><p>Thus, Marlow is able to toss out such bleeding-heart sentiments as
these:</p><blockquote><p>They were all dying slowly — it was very clear.They were not enemies,
they were not criminals, they were nothing earthly now — nothing but
black shadows of disease and starvation, lying confusedly in the greenish gloom. Brought from all the recesses of the coast in all the legality
of time contracts, lost in uncongenial surroundings, fed on unfamiliar
food, they sickened, became inefficient, and were then allowed to crawl
away and rest.<sup id=fnref:10><a href=#fn:10 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>10</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>The kind of liberalism espoused here by Marlow/Conrad touched
all the best minds of the age in England, Europe, and America. It took
different forms in the minds of different people but almost always managed to sidestep the ultimate question of equality between white people
and black people. That extraordinary missionary Albert Schweitzer, who
sacrificed brilliant careers in music and theology in Europe for a life of
service to Africans in much the same area as Conrad writes about, epitomizes the ambivalence. In a comment which has often been quoted
Schweitzer says:“The African is indeed my brother but my junior brother.”
And so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate to the needs of junior
brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice in the
days before the germ theory of disease came into being. Naturally he became a sensation in Europe and America. Pilgrims flocked, and I believe
still flock even after he has passed on, to witness the prodigious miracle
in Lambaréné, on the edge of the primeval forest.</p><p>Conrad’s liberalism would not take him quite as far as Schweitzer’s,
though. He would not use the word “brother” however qualified; the
farthest he would go was “kinship.” When Marlow’s African helmsman
falls down with a spear in his heart he gives his white master one final
disquieting look:</p><blockquote><p>And the intimate profundity of that look he gave me when he received his hurt remains to this day in my memory — like a claim of
distant kinship affirmed in a supreme moment.<sup id=fnref:11><a href=#fn:11 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>11</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>It is important to note that Conrad, careful as ever with his words, is
concerned not so much about “distant kinship” as about someone laying a claim on it. The black man lays a claim on the white man which is
well-nigh intolerable. It is the laying of this claim which frightens and at
the same time fascinates Conrad, “the thought of their humanity — like
yours&mldr; Ugly.”</p><p>The point of my observations should be quite clear by now, namely
that Joseph Conrad was a thoroughgoing racist. That this simple truth is
glossed over in criticisms of his work is due to the fact that white racism
against Africa is such a normal way of thinking that its manifestations go
completely unremarked. Students of Heart of Darkness will often tell you
that Conrad is concerned not so much with Africa as with the deterioration of one European mind caused by solitude and sickness. They will
point out to you that Conrad is, if anything, less charitable to the Europeans in the story than he is to the natives, that the point of the story is to
ridicule Europe’s civilizing mission in Africa. A Conrad student informed
me in Scotland that Africa is merely a setting for the disintegration of the
mind of Mr. Kurtz.</p><p>Which is partly the point. Africa as setting and backdrop which eliminates the African as human factor. Africa as a metaphysical battlefield
devoid of all recognizable humanity, into which the wandering European enters at his peril. Can nobody see the preposterous and perverse
arrogance in thus reducing Africa to the role of props for the breakup
of one petty European mind? But that is not even the point. The real
question is the dehumanization of Africa and Africans which this age long attitude has fostered and continues to foster in the world. And the
question is whether a novel which celebrates this dehumanization, which
depersonalizes a portion of the human race, can be called a great work
of art. My answer is: No, it cannot. I do not doubt Conrad’s great talents.
Even <em>Heart of Darkness</em> has its memorably good passages and moments:</p><blockquote><p>The reaches opened before us and closed behind, as if the forest had
stepped leisurely across the water to bar the way for our return.</p></blockquote><p>Its exploration of the minds of the European characters is often penetrating and full of insight. But all that has been more than fully discussed
in the last fifty years. His obvious racism has, however, not been addressed.
And it is high time it was!</p><p>Conrad was born in 1857, the very year in which the first Anglican
missionaries were arriving among my own people in Nigeria. It was
certainly not his fault that he lived his life at a time when the reputation
of the black man was at a particularly low level. But even after due allowances have been made for all the influences of contemporary prejudice on his sensibility, there remains still in Conrad’s attitude a residue
of antipathy to black people which his peculiar psychology alone can
explain. His own account of his first encounter with a black man is very
revealing:</p><blockquote><p>A certain enormous buck nigger encountered in Haiti fixed my con-
ception of blind, furious, unreasoning rage, as manifested in the human animal to the end of my days. Of the nigger I used to dream for
years afterwards.<sup id=fnref:12><a href=#fn:12 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>12</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Certainly Conrad had a problem with niggers. His inordinate love of
that word itself should be of interest to psychoanalysts. Sometimes his
fixation on blackness is equally interesting, as when he gives us this brief
description: “A black figure stood up, strode on long black legs, waving
long black arms”<sup id=fnref:13><a href=#fn:13 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>13</a></sup> — as though we might expect a black figure striding
along on black legs to wave white arms! But so unrelenting is Conrad’s
obsession.</p><p>As a matter of interest, Conrad gives us in <em>A Personal Record</em> what
amounts to a companion piece to the buck nigger of Haiti. At the age
of sixteen Conrad encountered his first Englishman in Europe. He calls
him “my unforgettable Englishman” and describes him in the following
manner:</p><blockquote><p>[his] calves exposed to the public gaze&mldr; dazzled the beholder by the
splendour of their marble-like condition and their rich tone of young
ivory&mldr; The light of a headlong, exalted satisfaction with the world
of men&mldr; illumined his face&mldr; and triumphant eyes. In passing he cast
a glance of kindly curiosity and a friendly gleam of big, sound, shiny
teeth&mldr; his white calves twinkled sturdily.<sup id=fnref:14><a href=#fn:14 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>14</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Irrational love and irrational hate jostling together in the heart of that
talented, tormented man. But whereas irrational love may at worst engender foolish acts of indiscretion, irrational hate can endanger the life of
the community. Naturally, Conrad is a dream for psychoanalytic critics.
Perhaps the most detailed study of him in this direction is by Bernard C.
Meyer, M.D. In his lengthy book, Dr. Meyer follows every conceivable
lead (and sometimes inconceivable ones) to explain Conrad. As an example, he gives us long disquisitions on the significance of hair and haircutting in Conrad. And yet not even one word is spared for his attitude
to black people. Not even the discussion of Conrad’s anti-Semitism was
enough to spark off in Dr. Meyer’s mind those other dark and explosive
thoughts. Which only leads one to surmise that Western psychoanalysts
must regard the kind of racism displayed by Conrad as absolutely normal
despite the profoundly important work done by Frantz Fanon in the
psychiatric hospitals of French Algeria.</p><p>Whatever Conrad’s problems were, you might say he is now safely
dead. Quite true. Unfortunately, his heart of darkness plagues us still.
Which is why an offensive and deplorable book can be described by
a serious scholar as “among the half-dozen greatest short novels in the
English language.” And why it is today perhaps the most commonly prescribed novel in twentieth-century literature courses in English departments of American universities.</p><p>There are two probable grounds on which what I have said so far may
be contested. The first is that it is no concern of fiction to please people
about whom it is written. I will go along with that. But I am not talking
about pleasing people. I am talking about a book which parades in the
most vulgar fashion prejudices and insults from which a section of mankind has suffered untold agonies and atrocities in the past and continues
to do so in many ways and many places today. I am talking about a story
in which the very humanity of black people is called in question.</p><p>Secondly, I may be challenged on the grounds of actuality. Conrad, after
all, did sail down the Congo in 1890 when my own father was still a babe
in arms. How could I stand up more than fifty years after his death and
purport to contradict him? My answer is that as a sensible man I will not
accept just any traveler’s tales solely on the grounds that I have not made
the journey myself. I will not trust the evidence even of a man’s very eyes
when I suspect them to be as jaundiced as Conrad’s. And we also happen to
know that Conrad was, in the words of his biographer, Bernard C. Meyer,
“notoriously inaccurate in the rendering of his own history.”<sup id=fnref:15><a href=#fn:15 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>15</a></sup></p><p>But more important by far is the abundant testimony about Conrad’s
savages which we could gather if we were so inclined from other sources
and which might lead us to think that these people must have had other
occupations besides merging into the evil forest or materializing out of
it simply to plague Marlow and his dispirited band. For as it happened,
soon after Conrad had written his book an event of far greater consequence was taking place in the art world of Europe. This is how Frank
Willett, a British art historian, describes it:</p><blockquote><p>Gauguin had gone to Tahiti, the most extravagant individual act of
turning to a non-European culture in the decades immediately before and after 1900, when European artists were avid for new artistic
experiences, but it was only about 1904–5 that African art began
to make its distinctive impact. One piece is still identifiable; it is a
mask that had been given to Maurice Vlaminck in 1905. He records
that Derain was “speechless” and “stunned” when he saw it, bought
it from Vlaminck and in turn showed it to Picasso and Matisse, who
were also greatly affected by it. Ambroise Vollard then borrowed it and
had it cast in bronze&mldr; The revolution of twentieth-century art was
under way!<sup id=fnref:16><a href=#fn:16 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>16</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>The mask in question was made by other savages living just north of
Conrad’s River Congo. They have a name too: the Fang people, and are
without a doubt among the world’s greatest masters of the sculptured
form. The event Frank Willett is referring to marked the beginning of
cubism and the infusion of new life into European art that had run completely out of strength.</p><p>The point of all this is to suggest that Conrad’s picture of the peoples
of the Congo seems grossly inadequate even at the height of their subjection to the savages of King Leopold’s International Association for the
Civilization of Central Africa.</p><p>Travelers with closed minds can tell us little except about themselves.
But even those not blinkered, like Conrad, with xenophobia can be astonishingly blind. Let me digress a little here. One of the greatest and
most intrepid travelers of all time, Marco Polo, journeyed to the Far
East from the Mediterranean in the thirteenth century and spent twenty
years in the court of Kublai Khan in China. On his return to Venice he
set down in his book entitled <em>Description of the World</em> his impressions of
the peoples and places and customs he had seen. But there were at least
two extraordinary omissions in his account. He said nothing about the
art of printing, unknown as yet in Europe but in full flower in China.</p><p>He either did not notice it at all or, if he did, failed to see what use
Europe could possibly have for it. Whatever the reason, Europe had to
wait another hundred years for Gutenberg. But even more spectacular
was Marco Polo’s omission of any reference to the Great Wall of China,
nearly four thousand miles long and already more than one thousand
years old at the time of his visit. Again, he may not have seen it; but the
Great Wall of China is the only structure built by man which is visible
from the moon!17 Indeed, travelers can be blind.</p><p>As I said earlier Conrad did not originate the image of Africa which
we find in his book. It was and is the dominant image of Africa in the
Western imagination and Conrad merely brought the peculiar gifts of
his own mind to bear on it. For reasons which can certainly use close
psychological inquiry, the West seems to suffer deep anxieties about the
precariousness of its civilization and to have a need for constant reassurance by comparison with Africa. If Europe, advancing in civilization,
could cast a backward glance periodically at Africa trapped in primordial
barbarity it could say with faith and feeling: There go I but for the grace
of God. Africa is to Europe as the picture is to Dorian Gray — a carrier
onto whom the master unloads his physical and moral deformities so that
he may go forward, erect and immaculate. Consequently, Africa is something to be avoided just as the picture has to be hidden away to safeguard
the man’s jeopardous integrity. Keep away from Africa, or else! Mr. Kurtz
of <em>Heart of Darkness</em> should have heeded that warning and the prowling
horror in his heart would have kept its place, chained to its lair. But he
foolishly exposed himself to the wild irresistible allure of the jungle and
lo! the darkness found him out.</p><p>In my original conception of this essay I had thought to conclude it
nicely on an appropriately positive note in which I would suggest from
my privileged position in African and Western cultures some advantages
the West might derive from Africa once it rid its mind of old prejudices
and began to look at Africa not through a haze of distortions and cheap
mystifications but quite simply as a continent of people — not angels but
not rudimentary souls either — just people, often highly gifted people and
often strikingly successful in their enterprise with life and society. But as I
thought more about the stereotype image, about its grip and pervasiveness,
about the wilful tenacity with which the West holds it to its heart; when I
thought of the West’s television and cinema and newspapers, about books
read in its schools and out of school, of churches preaching to empty pews
about the need to send help to the heathen in Africa, I realized that no easy optimism was possible. And there was in any case something totally wrong
in offering bribes to the West in return for its good opinion of Africa.
Ultimately the abandonment of unwholesome thoughts must be its own
and only reward. Although I have used the world “wilful” a few times
here to characterize the West’s view of Africa, it may well be that what
is happening at this stage is more akin to reflex action than calculated
malice. Which does not make the situation more but less hopeful.</p><p>The <em>Christian Science Monitor</em>, a paper more enlightened than most,
once carried an interesting article written by its Education Editor on the
serious psychological and learning problems faced by little children who
speak one language at home and then go to school where something
else is spoken. It was a wide-ranging article taking in Spanish-speaking
children in America, the children of migrant Italian workers in Germany,
the quadrilingual phenomenon in Malaysia and so on. And all this while
the article speaks unequivocally about language. But then out of the blue
sky comes this:</p><blockquote><p>In London there is an enormous immigration of children who speak
Indian or Nigerian dialects, or some other native language.<sup id=fnref:17><a href=#fn:17 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>17</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>I believe that the introduction of “dialects,” which is technically erroneous in the context, is almost a reflex action caused by an instinctive
desire of the writer to downgrade the discussion to the level of Africa
and India. And this is quite comparable to Conrad’s withholding of language from his rudimentary souls. Language is too grand for these chaps;
let’s give them dialects!</p><p>In all this business a lot of violence is inevitably done not only to
the image of despised peoples but even to words, the very tools of possible redress. Look at the phrase “native language” in the <em>Christian Science
Monitor excerpt</em>. Surely the only <em>native</em> language possible in London is
Cockney English. But our writer means something else — something
appropriate to the sounds Indians and Africans make!</p><p>Although the work of redressing which needs to be done may appear
too daunting, I believe it is not one day too soon to begin. Conrad saw
and condemned the evil of imperial exploitation but was strangely unaware of the racism on which it sharpened its iron tooth. But the victims
of racist slander who for centuries have had to live with the inhumanity
it makes them heir to have always known better than any casual visitor,
even when he comes loaded with the gifts of a Conrad.</p><h2 id=notes>Notes</h2><p>This is an amended version of the second Chancellor’s Lecture at the University
