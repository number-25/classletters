texts written about the post world-war II monetary institutions, from a so
called insider&amp;rsquo;s view. Having spent some time employed at the Overseas
Development Institute, the World Bank financed Teresa&amp;rsquo;s research on the
effectiveness of aid packages provided to Third World countries. Given it was
intended as a publication on behalf of the ODI, one certainly encounters a
report which offers an objective overview of the various policy approaches that
these institutions taken. The first half of the text, is an outline, not a
critique. The second half turns to evaluating the implementation of these
approaches in several countries. Here is where we find a critical evaluation,
which best portrays the inflexibility of foreign aid packages, which, Teresa
believed, were given more so as blanket prescriptions, dogmas even. A standard
buffet of currency devaluations and austerity measures &amp;mdash; liberalize,
liberalize, liberalize! It is for this reason that the Overseas Development
Institute rejected the original report for publication. Fortunately, it
eventually made it&amp;rsquo;s way to us common readers. The following is an excerpt from the
text, focusing on the involvement of these aid agencies in Chile, a country which is emblematic of the deep difficulties of modernization and sovereignty in the global periphery.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Capital Account Liberalization and the Developing Nations, an excerpt from Jos√© Antonio Ocampo</title><link>https://classletters.org/posts/assorted/capital_account_liberalization/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2024 22:34:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://classletters.org/posts/assorted/capital_account_liberalization/</guid><description>&lt;p>In looking to imagine and crystallise potential alternatives to the seemingly
unending vortex of underdevelopment and poverty in third and second world
nations, an understanding of the deficiencies and insufficiencies of the
current macroeconomic arrangement is an obvious starting point. The
post-Bretton Woods monetary consensus, which promised to guarantee mutual &amp;lsquo;real
growth&amp;rsquo; through endless liberalization of domestic markets and fluctuating exchange rates, has in whole been
failure for developing countries. Instead, of self-sufficiency and
self-confidence, there isn&amp;rsquo;t even what one one called &amp;lsquo;multi-lateral
beneficence&amp;rsquo;, but rather, a reliance and dependency on the most powerful players in the game, at the mercy of commodities swings and speculative exuberance
(rather than being &amp;rsquo;liberated&amp;rsquo; and domestically sound, buffered from &amp;lsquo;shocks&amp;rsquo;). One wonders what one
would do if they swapped shoes. What shall we do once we take control of these
responsibilities?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
