into the interwar period, eugenics &mdash; literally, ‘well born’ or ‘good stocks’&mdash; was the height of sophisticated, ‘progressive’ thought.<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> Across Europe, the
novels and plays of the period, such as H. G. Wells’s <em>The New Machiavelli</em>
(1911) and George Bernard Shaw’s <em>Man and Superman</em> (1905), are suffused
with the language of race-regeneration and fears of physical deterioration. In
Arthur Schnitzler’s novel, <em>The Road to the Open</em> (1908), Berthold Stauber, a
young and enthusiastic Viennese Jewish physician, tells his father, the
humane Dr Stauber, that ‘You need only consider, father, that the most
honest and consistent social hygiene would have the direct result of annihilating diseased people, or at any rate excluding them from all enjoyment of
life, and I don’t deny that I have all kinds of ideas tending in that way which
may seem cruel at the first glance.’ He went on to say that ‘You needn’t be
afraid, father, that I shall begin straight away to preach the murder of the
unhealthy and superfluous. But theoretically that’s certainly what my programme leads to.’<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> Although primarily a conservative ideology, both left and
right were attracted to eugenic proposals. These ranged from ‘positive’ measures such as the encouragement of ‘hygienic marriage’, that is, marriage
between two people of good stock, to ‘negative’ measures such as sterilisation or segregation in order to ensure that the unfit, feeble-minded and
morally degenerate did not have children. In this chapter I will consider
eugenics in general, before concentrating on one aspect of its rhetoric which
to a post-Second World War audience is perhaps even more shocking than it
was to an Edwardian one.</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 2, 2025</time></div></article><link rel=stylesheet type=text/css href=/css/katex.min.css crossorigin=anonymous><script type=text/javascript src=/js/katex.min.js crossorigin=anonymous></script><script type=text/javascript src=/js/auto-render.min.js onload=renderMathInElement(document.body) crossorigin=anonymous></script></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><div class=footer-mobile-links></div><script src=https://classletters.org/js/main.min.a7205ef73b078c8daed6fe1b0826e8ba229ffabbb69d299d9446cf41f2c7d8aa.js integrity="sha256-pyBe9zsHjI2u1v4bCCbouiKf+ru2nSmdlEbPQfLH2Ko=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
