It was a fine
autumn morning such as encouraged friendliness to passing strangers. Brisk
youngsters were hurrying in all directions, many of them obviously freshmen in their first flush of enthusiasm.An older man going the same way as I
turned and remarked to me how very young they came these days. I agreed.
Then he asked me if I was a student too. I said, no, I was a teacher.What did
I teach? African literature. Now that was funny, he said, because he knew a
fellow who taught the same thing, or perhaps it was African <em>history</em>, in a certain community college not far from here. It always surprised him, he went
on to say, because he never had thought of Africa as having that kind of
stuff, you know. By this time I was walking much faster. “Oh well,” I heard
him say finally, behind me: “I guess I have to take your course to find out.”</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>September 22, 2024</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://classletters.org/posts/assorted/neoliberal-africa-global-practice/>Global Neoliberal Practice: Institutions and Regulation in Africa by Graham Harrison</a></h2><div><p><p>This is a chapter out of Graham Harrison&rsquo;s Book &ldquo;Neoliberal Africa: The Impact
of Global Social Engineering&rdquo;. Although the book is more of an essay containing
fragmentary thoughts, I found this chapter substantial in the sense that it
clearly outlined the various institutional avenues in which projects such as
neoliberalism cement their ideology.</p><hr><p>This chapter considers the global emergence of neoliberalism. It looks at the
ways in which neoliberal practice has emerged, expanded and established for
itself ‘paradigmatic’ status. In other words, it shows how neoliberalism has
shifted from an ambitious and embryonic set of policy interventions to
something resembling a framework or set of premisses within which policy is
articulated. The practices of neoliberalism have been iterated over such time
as to shift the habits, conduct and repertoire of development practice tout
court. The layering of large numbers of neoliberal policies has not only led to
a progressively more totalising implementation of liberalisation; it has also
defined the terms upon which policy and development are thought about and
articulated per se. This is, of course, not a completed process (in the last
chapter we developed a framework which is anathema to the idea of completed
processes, preferring instead a series of practices in place of means–ends
distinctions), but it has enabled neoliberal ideas to aspire to
‘meta-development’ status: that is, as the terms upon which development is
discussed rather than solely as a predominant model of development. At the
level of ideas, this shift or tendency is rather like the analysis of Hay in
which neoliberalism moves from normalising to normative (Hay 2004).</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 1, 2023</time></div></article><link rel=stylesheet type=text/css href=/css/katex.min.css crossorigin=anonymous><script type=text/javascript src=/js/katex.min.js crossorigin=anonymous></script><script type=text/javascript src=/js/auto-render.min.js onload=renderMathInElement(document.body) crossorigin=anonymous></script></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><div class=footer-mobile-links></div><script src=https://classletters.org/js/main.min.a7205ef73b078c8daed6fe1b0826e8ba229ffabbb69d299d9446cf41f2c7d8aa.js integrity="sha256-pyBe9zsHjI2u1v4bCCbouiKf+ru2nSmdlEbPQfLH2Ko=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
