unending vortex of underdevelopment and poverty in third and second world
nations, an understanding of the deficiencies and insufficiencies of the
current macroeconomic arrangement is an obvious starting point. The
post-Bretton Woods monetary consensus, which promised to guarantee mutual &lsquo;real
growth&rsquo; through endless liberalization of domestic markets and fluctuating exchange rates, has in whole been
failure for developing countries. Instead, of self-sufficiency and
self-confidence, there isn&rsquo;t even what one one called &lsquo;multi-lateral
beneficence&rsquo;, but rather, a reliance and dependency on the most powerful players in the game, at the mercy of commodities swings and speculative exuberance
(rather than being &rsquo;liberated&rsquo; and domestically sound, buffered from &lsquo;shocks&rsquo;). One wonders what one
would do if they swapped shoes. What shall we do once we take control of these
responsibilities?</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 8, 2024</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://classletters.org/posts/biology/public_health/cancer_code/cancer_code_pt2/>Cancer Prevention and Screening by Jason Fung; The Cancer Code</a></h2><div><p><p>This is part 2 of the post on Jason Fung&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cancer Code&rsquo;. I found this a
remarkable case point in the iatrogenic potential of public health
interventions in which the effect on mortality is masked by a surrogate
of survival; early detection. When tracked for long enough time, early detection
does more harm than good, and thus, fails as a successful surrogate. You can
find part one
<a href=https://classletters.org/posts/biology/public_health/cancer_code/>here</a>.</p><p>I encourage everyone to read the entirety of Jason&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Cancer Code&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a
terrific work of &lsquo;popular&rsquo; scientific writing, a story as much about
the biology of Cancer as it is about the sociology of biomedical practice and
research.</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 28, 2024</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://classletters.org/posts/biology/public_health/cancer_code/cancer_code/>A False Dawn by Jason Fung; The Cancer Code</a></h2><div><p><p>This post will be in two parts, both of which I find are illustrative of the
difficulties of public health strategies. One makes particularly obvious the
severe misanthropic consequences of profit seeking drives in the areas of
health and medicine, and the second is a remarkable case point in the
iatrogenic potential of public health interventions which may be completely
benevolent in intention &ndash; something that all states irrespective of political
structure must address. Part one is contained below, you can find part two (here)[]</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 18, 2024</time></div></article><article><h2><a href=https://classletters.org/posts/assorted/neoliberal-africa-global-practice/>Global Neoliberal Practice: Institutions and Regulation in Africa by Graham Harrison</a></h2><div><p><p>This is a chapter out of Graham Harrison&rsquo;s Book &ldquo;Neoliberal Africa: The Impact
of Global Social Engineering&rdquo;. Although the book is more of an essay containing
fragmentary thoughts, I found this chapter substantial in the sense that it
clearly outlined the various institutional avenues in which projects such as
neoliberalism cement their ideology.</p><hr><p>This chapter considers the global emergence of neoliberalism. It looks at the
ways in which neoliberal practice has emerged, expanded and established for
itself ‘paradigmatic’ status. In other words, it shows how neoliberalism has
shifted from an ambitious and embryonic set of policy interventions to
something resembling a framework or set of premisses within which policy is
articulated. The practices of neoliberalism have been iterated over such time
as to shift the habits, conduct and repertoire of development practice tout
court. The layering of large numbers of neoliberal policies has not only led to
a progressively more totalising implementation of liberalisation; it has also
defined the terms upon which policy and development are thought about and
articulated per se. This is, of course, not a completed process (in the last
chapter we developed a framework which is anathema to the idea of completed
processes, preferring instead a series of practices in place of means–ends
distinctions), but it has enabled neoliberal ideas to aspire to
‘meta-development’ status: that is, as the terms upon which development is
discussed rather than solely as a predominant model of development. At the
level of ideas, this shift or tendency is rather like the analysis of Hay in
which neoliberalism moves from normalising to normative (Hay 2004).</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>April 1, 2023</time></div></article><link rel=stylesheet type=text/css href=/css/katex.min.css crossorigin=anonymous><script type=text/javascript src=/js/katex.min.js crossorigin=anonymous></script><script type=text/javascript src=/js/auto-render.min.js onload=renderMathInElement(document.body) crossorigin=anonymous></script></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><div class=footer-mobile-links></div><script src=https://classletters.org/js/main.min.a7205ef73b078c8daed6fe1b0826e8ba229ffabbb69d299d9446cf41f2c7d8aa.js integrity="sha256-pyBe9zsHjI2u1v4bCCbouiKf+ru2nSmdlEbPQfLH2Ko=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
