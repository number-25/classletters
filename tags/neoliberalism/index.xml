texts written about the post world-war II monetary institutions, from a so
called insider&amp;rsquo;s view. Having spent some time employed at the Overseas
Development Institute, the World Bank financed Teresa&amp;rsquo;s research on the
effectiveness of aid packages provided to Third World countries. Given it was
intended as a publication on behalf of the ODI, one certainly encounters a
report which offers an objective overview of the various policy approaches that
these institutions taken. The first half of the text, is an outline, not a
critique. The second half turns to evaluating the implementation of these
approaches in several countries. Here is where we find a critical evaluation,
which best portrays the inflexibility of foreign aid packages, which, Teresa
believed, were given more so as blanket prescriptions, dogmas even. A standard
buffet of currency devaluations and austerity measures &amp;mdash; liberalize,
liberalize, liberalize! It is for this reason that the Overseas Development
Institute rejected the original report for publication. Fortunately, it
eventually made it&amp;rsquo;s way to us common readers. The following is an excerpt from the
text, focusing on the involvement of these aid agencies in Chile, a country which is emblematic of the deep difficulties of modernization and sovereignty in the global periphery.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Capital Account Liberalization and the Developing Nations, an excerpt from José Antonio Ocampo</title><link>https://classletters.org/posts/assorted/capital_account_liberalization/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2024 22:34:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://classletters.org/posts/assorted/capital_account_liberalization/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In looking to imagine and crystallise potential alternatives to the seemingly
unending vortex of underdevelopment and poverty in third and second world
nations, an understanding of the deficiencies and insufficiencies of the
current macroeconomic arrangement is an obvious starting point. The
post-Bretton Woods monetary consensus, which promised to guarantee mutual &amp;lsquo;real
growth&amp;rsquo; through endless liberalization of domestic markets and fluctuating exchange rates, has in whole been
failure for developing countries. Instead, of self-sufficiency and
self-confidence, there isn&amp;rsquo;t even what one one called &amp;lsquo;multi-lateral
beneficence&amp;rsquo;, but rather, a reliance and dependency on the most powerful players in the game, at the mercy of commodities swings and speculative exuberance
(rather than being &amp;rsquo;liberated&amp;rsquo; and domestically sound, buffered from &amp;lsquo;shocks&amp;rsquo;). One wonders what one
would do if they swapped shoes. What shall we do once we take control of these
responsibilities?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cancer Prevention and Screening by Jason Fung; The Cancer Code</title><link>https://classletters.org/posts/biology/public_health/cancer_code/cancer_code_pt2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2024 23:41:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://classletters.org/posts/biology/public_health/cancer_code/cancer_code_pt2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is part 2 of the post on Jason Fung&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Cancer Code&amp;rsquo;. I found this a
remarkable case point in the iatrogenic potential of public health
interventions in which the effect on mortality is masked by a surrogate
of survival; early detection. When tracked for long enough time, early detection
does more harm than good, and thus, fails as a successful surrogate. You can
find part one
&lt;a href="https://classletters.org/posts/biology/public_health/cancer_code/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage everyone to read the entirety of Jason&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Cancer Code&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s a
terrific work of &amp;lsquo;popular&amp;rsquo; scientific writing, a story as much about
the biology of Cancer as it is about the sociology of biomedical practice and
research.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A False Dawn by Jason Fung; The Cancer Code</title><link>https://classletters.org/posts/biology/public_health/cancer_code/cancer_code/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2024 23:41:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://classletters.org/posts/biology/public_health/cancer_code/cancer_code/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This post will be in two parts, both of which I find are illustrative of the
difficulties of public health strategies. One makes particularly obvious the
severe misanthropic consequences of profit seeking drives in the areas of
health and medicine, and the second is a remarkable case point in the
iatrogenic potential of public health interventions which may be completely
benevolent in intention &amp;ndash; something that all states irrespective of political
structure must address. Part one is contained below, you can find part two (here)[]&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Global Neoliberal Practice: Institutions and Regulation in Africa by Graham Harrison</title><link>https://classletters.org/posts/assorted/neoliberal-africa-global-practice/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 22:51:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://classletters.org/posts/assorted/neoliberal-africa-global-practice/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a chapter out of Graham Harrison&amp;rsquo;s Book &amp;ldquo;Neoliberal Africa: The Impact
of Global Social Engineering&amp;rdquo;. Although the book is more of an essay containing
fragmentary thoughts, I found this chapter substantial in the sense that it
clearly outlined the various institutional avenues in which projects such as
neoliberalism cement their ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter considers the global emergence of neoliberalism. It looks at the
ways in which neoliberal practice has emerged, expanded and established for
itself ‘paradigmatic’ status. In other words, it shows how neoliberalism has
shifted from an ambitious and embryonic set of policy interventions to
something resembling a framework or set of premisses within which policy is
articulated. The practices of neoliberalism have been iterated over such time
as to shift the habits, conduct and repertoire of development practice tout
court. The layering of large numbers of neoliberal policies has not only led to
a progressively more totalising implementation of liberalisation; it has also
defined the terms upon which policy and development are thought about and
articulated per se. This is, of course, not a completed process (in the last
chapter we developed a framework which is anathema to the idea of completed
processes, preferring instead a series of practices in place of means–ends
distinctions), but it has enabled neoliberal ideas to aspire to
‘meta-development’ status: that is, as the terms upon which development is
discussed rather than solely as a predominant model of development. At the
level of ideas, this shift or tendency is rather like the analysis of Hay in
which neoliberalism moves from normalising to normative (Hay 2004).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
