&lt;h2 id="moral-conclusions">Moral Conclusions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It is possible to extend these observations to our own
societies. A considerable part of our morality and our lives
themselves are still permeated with this same atmosphere of
the gift, where obligation and liberty intermingle. Fortunately,
everything is still not wholly categorized in terms of buying
and selling. Things still have sentimental as well as venal value,
assuming values merely of this kind exist. We possess more
than a tradesman morality. There still remain people and
classes that keep to the morality of former times, and we
almost all observe it, at least at certain times of the year or
on certain occasions.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
