I found this a
remarkable case point in the iatrogenic potential of public health
interventions in which the effect on mortality is masked by a surrogate
of survival; early detection. When tracked for long enough time, early detection
does more harm than good, and thus, fails as a successful surrogate. You can
find part one

&lt;p&gt;I encourage everyone to read the entirety of Jason&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Cancer Code&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s a
terrific work of &amp;lsquo;popular&amp;rsquo; scientific writing, a story as much about
the biology of Cancer as it is about the sociology of biomedical practice and
research.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A False Dawn by Jason Fung; The Cancer Code</title><link>https://classletters.org/posts/biology/public_health/cancer_code/cancer_code/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2024 23:41:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://classletters.org/posts/biology/public_health/cancer_code/cancer_code/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This post will be in two parts, both of which I find are illustrative of the
difficulties of public health strategies. One makes particularly obvious the
severe misanthropic consequences of profit seeking drives in the areas of
health and medicine, and the second is a remarkable case point in the
iatrogenic potential of public health interventions which may be completely
benevolent in intention &amp;ndash; something that all states irrespective of political
structure must address. Part one is contained below, you can find part two (here)[]&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Revolutionary Medicine by Ernesto Che Guevara</title><link>https://classletters.org/posts/assorted/revolutionarey_medicine_che/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Aug 2023 07:31:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://classletters.org/posts/assorted/revolutionarey_medicine_che/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Adapted from &lt;a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1960/08/19.htm"&gt;https://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1960/08/19.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was put onto this article from the reading of the terrific
text on the Cuban and Venezuelan healthcare systems and practices by Steven
Brouwer: &lt;a href="https://monthlyreview.org/product/revolutionary_doctors/"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Revolutionary Doctors: How Venezuela and Cuba Are Changing the Worldâ€™s
Conception of Health Care&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple celebration, another among the hundreds of public functions with
which the Cuban people daily celebrate their liberty, the progress of all their
revolutionary laws, and their advances along the road to complete independence,
is of special interest to me.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
