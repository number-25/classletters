Myth of the Market Economy&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;, a book that offers a critique of what a &amp;lsquo;market
economy&amp;rsquo; is purported to be, through an evaluation of the strategies and
economic histories of businesses within what can be called &amp;ldquo;actually existing
capitalism&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Here, at the risk of a small amount of
repetition, I shall supplement that discussion by focusing on the nature
of fixed costs, the different sources of uncertainty the innovative organization faces, and the relation between organizational capability and technological change.
Through its investment activities, a business organization commits financial resources to specific processes to make particular products with
the expectation of reaping financial returns. Once they are committed,
the productive assets of the organization represent fixed costs that must
then be recouped by the production and sale of output. If, through the
sale of sufficient output, investments could generate expected financial
returns instantaneously, fixed costs would not represent an economic
problem to the organization. But then, we would probably not call the
“assets” underlying these costs “investments.” Indeed, we might not even
deem it appropriate to call these costs “fixed” or the entity that incurs
them a firm. The problem of fixed costs occurs because the production
and sale of the enterprise’s output occur neither instantaneously nor with
certainty. The basic economic problem that confronts the capitalist enterprise is to transform fixed costs into revenue-generating products to realize financial returns. An analysis of how and with what success the business organization manages this transformation is the key to understanding
technological change, value creation, and economic growth.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
