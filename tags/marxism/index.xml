Author and reader may well ask why they should be republished just now. At first sight they might seem to lack all topicality. Subject and tone alike may appear remote to a considerable section of public opinion. I believe, however, that they have some topicality in that, without entering upon any detailed polemics, they represent a point of view in opposition to certain literary and philosophical trends still very much to the fore today.</description></item><item><title>Marx, Race and Neoliberalism by Adolph Reed Jr.</title><link>https://classletters.org/posts/adolph-reed-jr/marx_race_neoliberalism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Sep 2023 02:47:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://classletters.org/posts/adolph-reed-jr/marx_race_neoliberalism/</guid><description>A Marxist perspective can be most helpful for understanding race and racism insofar as it per- ceives capitalism dialectically, as a social total- ity that includes modes of production, relations of production, and the pragmatically evolving ensemble of institutions and ideologies that lubricate and propel its reproduction. From this perspective, Marxism’s most important contri- bution to making sense of race and racism in the United States may be demystification. A histori- cal materialist perspective should stress that “race”—which includes “racism,” as one is unthinkable without the other—is a historically specific ideology that emerged, took shape, and has evolved as a constitutive element within a definite set of social relations anchored to a par- ticular system of production.</description></item></channel></rss>
