The text speaks for itself &amp;ndash; a terrific contextualisation of the National Liberation Movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of us came to Cuba with doubts in our mind about the solidity, strength,
maturity and vitality of the Cuban Revolution, these doubts have been removed
by what we have been able to see. Our hearts are now warmed by an unshakeable
certainty which gives us courage in the difficult but glorious struggle against
the common enemy: no power in the world will be able to destroy this Cuban
Revolution, which is creating in the countryside and in the towns not only a
new life but also — and even more important — a New Man, fully conscious of his
national, continental and international rights and duties. In every field of
activity the Cuban people have made major progress during the last seven years,
particularly in 1965, Year of Agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Seven Types of Obloquy: Traversties of Marxism by Norman Geras:</title><link>https://classletters.org/posts/geras/seven_types/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2024 04:01:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://classletters.org/posts/geras/seven_types/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I see this as a terrific example of where reasoned and well formed criticism
can stand on its own, in spite of the divergent trajectory which the author
appears to take later on in his life through his reactionary offshoots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any analytical field of inquiry which aspires to achieving insights, syntheses and increased understandings of the world, Marxism contains a broad array of unique and differeing perspectives, some of which fall far short of the high standard of rigor demanded of a scientific field. Here, Geras addresses several lazy and incongruent arguments put forward by Marxists who are themselves claiming to remedy pitfalls in Marx&amp;rsquo;s views; a public purging of sorts, these types of obloquy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Studies in European Realism by György Lukács</title><link>https://classletters.org/posts/lukacs/studies_in_european_realism/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2023 02:07:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://classletters.org/posts/lukacs/studies_in_european_realism/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The articles contained in this book were written some ten years ago. Author and reader
may well ask why they should be republished just now. At first sight they might seem to
lack all topicality. Subject and tone alike may appear remote to a considerable section of
public opinion. I believe, however, that they have some topicality in that, without
entering upon any detailed polemics, they represent a point of view in opposition to
certain literary and philosophical trends still very much to the fore today.
Let us begin with the general atmosphere: the clouds of mysticism which once
surrounded the phenomena of literature with a poetic colour and warmth and created
an intimate and ‘‘interesting’’ atmosphere around them, have been dispersed. Things
now face us in a clear, sharp light which to many may seem cold and hard; a light shed
on them by the teachings of Marx. Marxism searches for the material roots of each
phenomenon, regards them in their historical connections and movement, ascertains the
laws of such movement and demonstrates their development from root to flower, and in
so doing lifts every phenomenon out of a merely emotional, irrational, mystic fog and
brings it to the bright light of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Marx, Race and Neoliberalism by Adolph Reed Jr.</title><link>https://classletters.org/posts/adolph-reed-jr/marx_race_neoliberalism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Sep 2023 02:47:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://classletters.org/posts/adolph-reed-jr/marx_race_neoliberalism/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A Marxist perspective can be most helpful for understanding race and racism
insofar as it per- ceives capitalism dialectically, as a social total- ity that
includes modes of production, relations of production, and the pragmatically
evolving ensemble of institutions and ideologies that lubricate and propel its
reproduction. From this perspective, Marxism’s most important contri- bution to
making sense of race and racism in the United States may be demystification. A
histori- cal materialist perspective should stress that “race”—which includes
“racism,” as one is unthinkable without the other—is a historically specific
ideology that emerged, took shape, and has evolved as a constitutive element
within a definite set of social relations anchored to a par- ticular system of
production.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
