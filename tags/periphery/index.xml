&lt;p&gt;If any of us came to Cuba with doubts in our mind about the solidity, strength,
maturity and vitality of the Cuban Revolution, these doubts have been removed
by what we have been able to see. Our hearts are now warmed by an unshakeable
certainty which gives us courage in the difficult but glorious struggle against
the common enemy: no power in the world will be able to destroy this Cuban
Revolution, which is creating in the countryside and in the towns not only a
new life but also — and even more important — a New Man, fully conscious of his
national, continental and international rights and duties. In every field of
activity the Cuban people have made major progress during the last seven years,
particularly in 1965, Year of Agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
