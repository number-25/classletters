can stand on its own, in spite of the divergent trajectory which the author
appears to take later on in his life through his reactionary offshoots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any analytical field of inquiry which aspires to achieving insights, syntheses and increased understandings of the world, Marxism contains a broad array of unique and differeing perspectives, some of which fall far short of the high standard of rigor demanded of a scientific field. Here, Geras addresses several lazy and incongruent arguments put forward by Marxists who are themselves claiming to remedy pitfalls in Marx&amp;rsquo;s views; a public purging of sorts, these types of obloquy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
