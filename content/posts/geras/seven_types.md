Norman Geras - a terrific example of where reasoned and well formed critique can stand on its own, in spite of the divergent trajectory which the author appears to take later on. 


Also a good excuse to re-up and reformat this article which has some bad

# Seven Types of Obloquy

One comes across the strangest arguments these days. If you happen to be
interested in  Marxist thought, whether as history of ideas or as ideas of
history, you find yourself quite regularly surprised. You  may find  yourself
startled even, at the character of some of what you encounter. I offer here a
modest compilation of examples, with accompanying critical commentary. The
principles governing the compilation are few. Examples are all from writers of
the Left and  from writings of  the 1980s. Seven broad  types of argument are
reviewed; each type prominent within contemporary socialist discussion - though
I make no claim to their being exhaustive of the genre of criticism they
represent. Together, the assembled examples provide a kind of snapshot of
something, that is all. The sequence of them is interrupted here and there by a
digression.

## 1. Smiling Marxists 

Obloquy', as generally understood, means something very pronounced: speaking
ill of a person or - as it may also be and is here - tradition of thought. I
use the word in that sense. Instances of the first type of obloquy, which I
shall be considering in this section, are unified by (loosely speaking) their
style rather than their substance. They differ in that from the six types to
follow, whose unity is thematic. The style defining the first type of obloquy
is that of the quick, casual disparagement, untroubled by effort of  serious
proof or even advocacy: the small, avoidable falsehood or lightminded
absurdity; the rendering of an opposing viewpoint in transparently
prejudicial terms; the passing caricature or easy oversimplification; each of
these generally in cahoots with others like it in the same text - for authors
permitting themselves one usually permit themselves many - and cumulatively
producing a not very good impression of their object. Here are some examples of
such a 'style' of recent critical discussion.  

Jon Elster gives his readers to
understand that Marx may have thought 'each individual...has all the
capacities that any other has', a view he finds 'extremely' utopian, 'by its
denial of any genetically determined differences in ability.' Curious here is
that in support of the suggestion he adduces but one line from the *Grundrisse*
which speaks, in a general way, about the artistic and scientific 'development'
of individuals in a prospective - better - future. This seems different from
saying that everyone has identical inherent abilities. It is all Elster offers.
Except, that is, for a broad gesture towards 'the corpus as a whole, which
never to my knowledge refers to differences in natural talents.' Also curious
is that there is a famous passage in the *Critique of the Gotha Programme*,
concerning the distributive principles suitable to a post-capitalist order, and
in which Marx says things like: 'But one man is superior to another physically
or mentally...'; and 'it [a particular distributive principle] tacitly
recognizes unequal individual endowment and thus productive capacity as natural
privileges'; and individuals 'would not be different individuals if they
were  not unequal'; and 'From each according to his abilities, to each
according to his needs!' Elster discusses the passage at some length elsewhere
in his own text. Oversights are perfectly possible. How odd, though, unless on
the basis of the clearest statement or entailment to this effect, to credit
someone with the belief that we all have the same natural aptitude to be
sprinters, or weightlifters, or mathematicians.'   

There is a certain kind of socialist, according to John Keane, by whom it is
supposed that 'under conditions of genuine socialism...all decisions in
public affairs, no matter how small or insignificant, will be taken directly
by the community as a whole'. Whoever else  he may be thinking of here, he is
anyway thinking of the Marxist kind of socialist, for this is what Marx
supposed, so we are told, in 'a species of the collective harmony myth': 'All
communist beings would make decisions on all public matters, no matter how
insignificant, and without resorting to separate political institutions for
securing agreements or reconciling conflicts.' Amongst the many and difficult
problems Man bequeathed to the Marxist tradition through what he did and did
not say about the regulative institutions of a future communist society, this
one had, I confess, hitherto escaped my notice: that everybody would have to be
directly involved in the siting of each road sign. I had come across Marx's
references to the continued existence of a 'public power' and the mechanism of
elections; Engels's scepticism towards the notion of being able to dispense
with the 'authority of the majority over the minority'; some reflections, even,
of August Bebel, concerning 'democratic' elections to 'positions of trust' in a
central administration, with the possibility of recall and re-election 'if this
is demanded by circumstances or the electors deem it desirable' - and had come
across a bit more yet (some of it to be detailed later) pointing to a picture
of communist  public affairs slightly  more mediated and less harmonious than
Keane suggests. Keane is  perhaps exaggerating. But how odd to exaggerate so.[^2]


How very odd, really, when you reflect upon it, a society of  people endowed
with exactly the same natural talents; or of people all directly deciding about
everything, 'no matter how small'. It would be itself, doubtless, excessive
were we to say of this form of discourse about Marxism that it turns your
average Marxist into someone who thinks all humankind will be permanently
smiling 'after the revolution'; or into someone whose beliefs are consonant
only with the wearing of an inane grin. Stuart Hall  commends Antonio Gramsci:
'Where  Gramsci departs from classical versions of Marxism is that he does not
think that politics is an arena which simply reflects already unified
collective political identities, already constituted forms of struggle.' This
is good for Gramsci but bad for classical Marxism. To that category we may take
it Marx belongs, and Luxemburg and Lenin also. Now, it seems hard to give a
clear meaning to Lenin's thinking on the revolutionary party, or on the
strategy of proletarian-peasant alliance in pre-1917 Russia, if it was a
matter for him of already unified collective political identities. Equally,
it is hard on such a basis to understand the mass strike's significance for
Luxemburg: as formative, educative, unlfying indeed; as constitutive of a new
and active, self-governing political identity for the working class. These two
were familiar with the distinction Marx made between a class-in-itself and a
class-for-itself, and with what it implied about long, difficult struggles,
about learning from the experience of them, about interruptions and defeats.
Stuart Hall is familiar with the same distinction. He calls it 'Marx's
formidable distinction between a class "in itself" and one which has developed
sufficient political, cultural and strategic unity to become an active force in
history- "for itself'...' This seems rather better for classical Marxism. It
could be the difference between Gramsci and less saintly figures in the
tradition is poorly formulated.[^3]   

'Marxism's more scientific adherents...implicitly assumed the God's eye view
of a transcendental, monological meta-subject able to grasp the whole from  a
presumed  point exterior to it.' So says Martin Jay. That is some subject,
all right: with a God's eye, and transcendental, and monological, and meta
- and when Marxism's more scientific adherents have not been so sympathetic to
notions of deity or transcendental subjecthood. It is perhaps merely an
emphatic expression of the well-known and properly lamented tendency towards
dogmatism in certain Marxist circles. No, it is not that. The target is
other; contained in the words 'to grasp the whole'. Jay's target is
'totalistic knowledge'. What exact pejorative weight falls, for him,
respectively on 'totalistic' and on 'knowledge' (as in 'more scientific
adherents') is hard to say. But such, in any case, are the features of the
historical-materialist enterprise - its aspiration to understand different
forms of society, to explain their general character - which convict Marxism of
the arrogant God's eye view.[^4]    

Another who is worried about totality is Jean Cohen. The problem which troubles
her is Marx's 'one single totalizing logic, the logic of a "mode of
production"...[S]uch a totalistic theory dangerously excludes the possibility
(which we of the twentieth century ought to know well) that there might be
other modes of domination than socioeconomic class relations, other principles
of stratification in addition to class (nationality, race, status, sex, etc.)...' Note that the said totalistic theory, according to Cohen, does not merely
give primary emphasis to class, nor even just understate, perhaps, the
importance of other modes of domination. It 'excludes the possibility' of them.
Cohen excludes the possibility of things I definitely remember reading: Marx
saying that 'the general position of women in modem society is inhuman', and
that 'Labour cannot emancipate itself in the white skin where in the black
it is branded'; Engels saying of Germany that a nation which has allowed
itself to be used as 'a tool of oppression against...other nations' must
entirely renounce that past; Lenin following the two of them in declaring 'no
nation can be free if it oppresses other nations'; Luxemburg remarking on the
special sorrows of children; Trotsky, likewise, writing of the 'darkness' and
'dependence' of so many childhoods, and that a 'revolution does not deserve
its name if it does not take the greatest care possible of the children';
and writing of 'Woman...at last freeing] herself from her semi-servile
condition'; Adorno speaking of 'the husband's barbarous power over the property
and work of his wife' and of 'the lying ideology which sets up the man as
superior'; Deutscher (yes, even in  an essay with the title '*On Socialist Man*')
looking forward to the end of 'the present family, with...its dependence of
woman and child on father' - and so, if  need be, on.[^5]    

Stuart Hall also has something to say about all this singularity: 'We cannot
imagine socialism coming about any longer through the image of that single,
singular subject we used to call Socialist Man. Socialist Man, with one mind,
one set of interests, one project, is dead. And good riddance. Who needs 'him'
now...with 'his' particular sense of masculinity, shoring 'his' identity up
in a particular set of familial relations, a particular kind of sexual
identity? Who needs 'him' as the singular identity through which the great
diversity of human beings and ethnic cultures in our world must enter the
twenty-first century?'[^6] These writers, it may be observed in passing, are ever
so contemporary. They invoke the twentieth, or the prospect of the
twenty-first, century; say 'we ought to know' and 'we cannot any longer
imagine'. And they draw all the while a picture of these grinning - and
shrunken - predecessors. Beware when the writer writes, 'We know, today...'
Does she know, or is that currently the thing to say? And what he knows, was it
perhaps also known yesterday? Was it known by someone, known at least in part?   

Gösta Esping Anderson interprets Lenin: 'if socialists take parliamentary
democracy seriously, they will betray the proletarian cause by helping obscure
the nature of class struggle. Even worse, their participation will serve only
to perpetuate and strengthen class exploitation, thus delaying the inevitable
revolutionary moment.' By contrast with Kautsky, for whom 'parliamentary
participation can develop the proletariat's capacity for socialist politics,'
Lenin is said to have held that 'participation in bourgeois
institutions...would corrupt working class politics.' This is the same Lenin
as he whose strategic perspective for the Russian workers' movement over more
than a decade was summed up thus: 'there is not, nor can there be, any other
path to real freedom for the proletariat and the peasantry, than the path of
bourgeois freedom and bourgeois progress'; who railed against 'the hoary
Narodnik theory that...we do not need bourgeois political liberty', and
against 'anarchism which denies any participation of the proletariat in
bourgeois politics...in bourgeois parliamentarism'; who, in State and
Revolution (Esping Anderson's alleged source), spoke of the benefits to the
proletariat of the 'wider, freer and more open form of the class struggle'
vouchsafed by the democratic-republican type of bourgeois state; who upheld in
fact 'the viewpoint that it was...obligatory to participate even in a most
reactionary parliament'; that 'participation in parliamentary elections and in
the struggle on the parliamentary rostrum is obligatory on the party of the
revolutionary proletariat.' Esping Anderson feels 'It is impossible to cling
to Leninism when one engages in empirical analysis.' You can see what he
means.[^7]   

The list of such examples could be extended at will. But this first
type of obloquy is now sufficiently exemplified. The above instances of it
are all representative of the style: off-the-cuff, belittling - and, upon
examination, feeble. They are not chosen, however, only for the style. They
also signal, loosely, the substantive themes of the other six types of
obloquy, to be pursued after the following short digression.    

### Snapshot
There is any number of reasons, cogent, intellectually arguable, morally
understandable or otherwise worthy of respect, why a person might not be, not
want to be or not choose to call herself or himself a Marxist; and there is
any number of reasons therefore - again, cogent, intellectually arguable,
morally understandable or otherwise worthy of respect - why, Marxist or not,
someone might be critical of this intellectual tradition, whether individual
aspects or whole areas of it.   

They might feel that Marxism to date has had too
little to offer towards a theory of the political institutions necessary for
any genuinely democratic community, deficiency enough when problems of
political mediation will be with us for good. Or might think that, in
historical and social explanation, although Marxism explains something or even
quite a lot, there is too much which it cannot explain. Or might hold, on the
basis of their judgement of whatever evidence they take to be relevant, that
its central theoretical claims are wrong or at least not proven. They might
not wish to appear to identify themselves with a primary emphasis on the effort
to end economic exploitation and class division, in a world with more
inequities than these. Even recognizing the desirability of socialism, they
might doubt its probability, whether because of the discredit brought upon it
by the regimes that have claimed its name, or for older and deeper reasons. Or
they might wonder from where, or from what, credible agencies or strategies of
socialism will emerge. They might feel, from within the 'inwardness' of their
own personal sphere and their sense of its importance to them, that Marxism
will not help them much towards understanding or fulfilment here. Or feel that
its major thinkers have had too little time for problems of moral philosophy,
germane though these are to any project of human emancipation. Or feel, in the
light of a religious or other metaphysical belief, that Marxism has had nothing
or not the right sort of thing to say to them about the most profound meanings
of life and death. They might just think that contributions to our knowledge
of the social world have been too many and varied for it to be sensible to
identify oneself with a label deriving from the name of one man.[^8]    

There is, to put it otherwise, plenty of room for difference with, and for
difference within, this tradition of thought; for serious substantive criticism
of it; for argument over its shortcomings that is precise and worthwhile.
Why, then, with no lack of matter for sober critical discussion, is there on
the Left today such a volume of caricature, ill-informed oversimplification
and generally facile disputation in the treatment of Marxist thought? Note the
specifications of time and milieu in the question. For Marxism has always been
subject to this sort of thing. The sources of it, moreover, were generally not
hard to see: overt political hostility, prejudice and the like. But the same
easy critical themes, the same kinds of misrepresentation and distortion as
were fed by such sources, now come from writers of the Left overtly open to
what is positive in Marxist thought, and sometimes professing, indeed, a form
of  Marxism themselves. And they come from them after two decades in which a
flourishing of debate and scholarship in this area has nuanced and enriched
Marxism itself, as well as confounding the more vulgar representations of it
which prevailed at the beginning of the period, during the Cold War. The point
can be accentuated still further. It is possible to identify the themes and
inflections of this new obloquy even confining oneself, as I mostly do here,
to work of some quality: to the writings of serious scholars, some of them of
considerable intellectual standing.     

Whatever the explanation for it, the phenomenon itself is unmistakable.
Amongst writers and academics across a significant sector of the Left, an
impulse has lately grown towards the taking of some 'extra' distance, so to
say, from Marxism. That is  the subject of this snapshot: for the record, a
moment of intellectual history when good reasons did not suffice; the actual
standard of  some of the reasons put forth.   

## Amazing Reductions  
There are three common variants of the discursive form to be treated next. Its
theme was foreshadowed more than once in Section I. It is that Marxism is -
inescapably - reductionist. An example of this second type of obloquy, in the
first of the three variants I distinguish, is provided by Jean Cohen. She
writes: 'The base/superstructure model, according to which the state, law, and
ideology are conceived as determined ("in the last instance") by the mode of
production...implies that political power and domination represent something
else: the social relations of domination of the only sphere with real weight in
the historical materialist framework, the economy.' It obviously follows, if
the economy is the only sphere with real weight in the model, that no other
sphere has real weight in it; and it must seem reasonable, if that is so, to
say that the 'reduction' thereby perpetrated 'precludes the investigation of
the internal dynamics of the political sphere and the nature of the power of
those who occupy its ranks.' Cohen says it. She is very quick on the subject of
what Marxism precludes. Before, remember, it was other modes of domination than
class; now, it is merely investigation of the dynamics of the political
sphere.[^9]   

This first variant is  the simple one. It simplifies. Marxism has here been
rather pared down; reduced, in fact. For Cohen's is not the only version of
the base/supersbructure model. What student of Marxism can really be unaware of
that today? She herself allows to peep out at us from between scarequotes the
phrase, 'in the last instance'. It has two immediate associations: a letter
from Engels to Bloch, and the writings of Louis Althusser. Expressly argued in
both is  that the economy is not the only sphere with real weight; that it
would be 'senseless' indeed (Engels) so to construe it.[^10] On a conservative
estimate, this must now have been argued by several dozen Marxist writers.
Cohen just discounts the fact. And, with respect to 'the internal dynamics of
the political sphere and the nature of the power of  those who occupy its
ranks', she discounts a few other things as well. Marx's analysis of
Bonapartism, for example, is mentioned by her in this connection, but as
exceptional only, 'an extraordinary deviation from the paradigm of class rule'.
Also exceptional, one must suppose, would be Thalheimer or Trotsky on fascism,
and Gramsci on hegemony, and Althusser on repressive and ideological state
apparatuses, Miliband or Poulantzas on  the capitalist state, virtually the
whole classical Marxist tradition on  the difference  between
parliamentary-democratic and autocratic forms of rule, and a  certain amount of
recent discussion of the notion of relative autonomy -to some of which material
Cohen even refers.
