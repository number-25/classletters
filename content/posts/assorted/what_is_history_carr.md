"That elusive entity 'human nature' has varied so much from country to country
and from century to century that it is difficult not to regard it as a
historical phenomenon shaped by prevailing social conditions and conventions.
There are many differences between, say, Americans, Russians, and Indians. But
some, and perhaps the most important, of these differences take the form of
different attitudes to social relations between individuals, or, in other
words, to the way in which society should be constituted, so that the study of
differences between American, Russian, and Indian society as a whole may well
turn out to be the best way of studying differences between individual
Americans, Russians, and Indians. Civilized man, like primitive man, is moulded
by society just as effectively as society is moulded by him. You can no more
have the egg without the hen than you can have the hen without the egg."

"It would have been unnecessary to dwell on these very obvious truths but for
the fact that they have been obscured for us by the remarkable and exceptional
period of history from which the western world is only just emerging. The cult
of individual- ism is one of the most pervasive of modern historical myths.
According to the familiar account in Burckhardt's *Civilisation of the
Renaissance in Italy*, the second part of which is subtitled 'The Development of
the Individual', the cult of the individual began with the Renaissance, when
man, who had hitherto been 'conscious of himself only as a member of a race,
people, party, family, or corporation', at length 'became a spiritual
individual and recognized himself as such'. Later the cult was connected with
the rise of capitalism and of Protestantism, with the beginnings of the
industrial revolution, and with the doctrines of laissez-faire. The rights of
man and the citizen proclaimed by the French revolution were the rights of the
individual. Individualism was the basis of the great nineteenth- century
philosophy of utilitarianism, Morley's essay On Compromise, a characteristic
document of Victorian liberalism, called individualism and utilitarianism 'the
religion of human happiness and well-being'. 'Rugged individualism' was the
keynote of human progress.  This may be a perfectly sound and valid analysis of
the ideology of a particular historical epoch. But what I want to make clear is
that the increased individualization which accompanied the rise of the modern
world was a ·normal process of advancing civilization. A social revolution
brought new social groups to positions of power. It operated, as always,
through individuals and by offering fresh opportunities of individual
development; and, since in the early stages of capitalism the units of
production and distribution were largely in the hands of single individuals,
the ideology of the new social order strongly emphasized the role of individual
initiative in the social order. But the whole process was a social process
representing a specific stage in historical development, and cannot be
explained in terms of a revolt of individuals against society or of an
emancipation of individuals from social restraints."   

"This truism is not less true when the period treated by the historian is
remote from his own time. When I studied ancient history, the classics on the
subject were - and probably still are - Grote's *History of Greece* and Mommsen's
*History of Rome*. Grote, an enlightened radical- banker writing in the I840s,
embodied the aspirations of the rising and politically progressive British
middle class in an idealized picture of Athenian democracy, in which Pericles
figured as a Benthanite reformer and Athens acquired an empire in a fit of
absence of mind. It may not be fanciful to suggest that Grote's neglect of the
problem of slavery in Athens reflected the failure of the group to which he
belonged to face the problem of the new English factory working class. Mommsen
was a German liberal, disillusioned by the muddles and humiliations of the
German revolution of 1848-9.  Writing in the 1850s - the decade which saw the
birth of the name and concept of Realpolitik - Mommsen was imbued with the
sense of need for a strong man to clear up the mess left by the failure of the
German people to realize its political aspirations; and we shall never
appreciate his history at its true value unless we realize that his well-known
idealization of Caesar is the product of this yearning for the strong man to
save Germany from ruin, and that the lawyer-politician Cicero that ineffective
chatterbox and slippery procrastinator, has walked straight out of the debates
of the Paulikirche in Frankfurt in 1948. Indeed, I should not think it an
outrageous paradox if someone were to say that Grote's *History of Greece* has
quite as much to tell us today about the thought of the English philosophical
radicals in the 1840s as about Athenian democracy in the fifth century B.C., or
that anyone wishing to understand what 1848 did to the German liberals should
take Mommsen's *History of Rome* as one of his text-books."   

"The Bolsheviks knew that the French revolution had ended in a Napoleon, and
feared that their own revolution might end in the same way. They therefore
mistrusted Trotsky, who among their leaders looked most like a Napoleon, and
trusted Stalin, who looked least like a Napoleon. But this process may work in
a converse direction. The economist who, by a scientific analysis of existing
economic conditions, predicts an approaching boom or slump may, if his
authority is great and his arguments cogent, contribute by the very fact of his
prediction to the occurrence of the phenomenon predicted. The political
scientist who, on the strength of historical observations, nourishes the
conviction that despotism is short-lived, may contribute to the downfall of the
despot. Everyone is familiar with the behaviour of candidates at elections, who
predict their own victory for the conscious purpose of rendering the fulfilment
of the prediction more likely; and one suspects that economists, political
scientists, and historians, when they venture on prediction, are sometimes
inspired by the unconscious hope of hastening the realization of the
prediction.  All that one can perhaps safely say about these complex relations
is that interaction between the observer and what is observed, between the
social scientist and his data, between the historian and his facts, is
continuous, and continuously varies; and that this appears to be a distinctive
feature of history and of the social sciences."   

"Historians
condone the nineteenth-century colonisation of Asia and Africa by the western nations on
the ground not only of its immediate effects on the world economy, but of its long-term
consequences for the backward peoples of these continents. After all, it is said, modern
India is the child of British rule; and modern China is the product of nineteenth-century
western imperialism, crossed with the influence of the Russian revolution. Unfortunately it
was not the Chinese workers who laboured in the western-owned factories in the treaty
ports, or in the South African mines, or on the western front in the First World War, who
have survived to enjoy whatever glory or profit may have accrued from the Chinese
revolution. Those who pay the cost are rarely those who reap the benefits. The well-known
purple passage from Engels is uncomfortably apt:  

>History is about the most cruel of all goddesses, and she leads her triumphal car over
heaps of corpses, not only in war, but also in 'peaceful' economic development. And we
men and women are unfortunately so stupid that we never pluck up courage for real
progress unless urged to it by sufferings that seem almost out of proportion.'

Ivan Karamazov's famous gesture of defiance is a heroic fallacy. We are born into society,
we are born into history. No moment: occurs when we are offered a ticket of admission
with the option to accept or reject it. The historian has no more conclusive answer than the
theologian to the problem of suffering." 

"Antony's infatuation with Cleopatra, or
Bajazet's attack of gout, or Trotsky's feverish chill, were just as much causally determined
as anything else that happens. It is unnecessarily discourteous to Cleopatra's beauty to
suggest that Antony's infatuation had no cause. The connexion between female beauty and
male infatuation is one of the most regular sequences of cause and effect observable in
everyday life. These so-called accidents in history represent a sequence of cause and effect
interrupting - and, so to speak, clashing with - the sequence which the historian is
primarily concerned to investigate. Bury, quite rightly, speaks of a 'collision of two
independent causal chains'.' Sir Isaiah Berlin, who opens his essay on Historical
Inevitability by citing with praise an article of Bernard Berenson on 'The Accidental View
of History, is one of those who confuse accident in this sense with an absence of causal
determination. But, this confusion apart, we have a real problem on our hands. How can
one discover in history a coherent sequence of cause and effect, how can we find any
meaning in history, when our sequence is liable to be broken or deflected at any moment
by some other, and from our point of view irrelevant, sequence?  

We may pause here for a moment to notice the origin of this recent widespread insistence
on the role of chance in history. Polybius appears to have been the first historian to occupy
himself with it in any systematic way; and Gibbon was quick to unmask the reason. ‘The
Greeks', observed Gibbon, ‘after their country had been reduced to a province, imputed the
triumphs of Rome not to the merit, but to the fortune, of the republic.' Tacitus, also a
historian of the decay of his country, was another ancient historian to indulge in extensive
reflexions on chance. The renewed insistence by British writers on the importance of
accident in history dates from the growth of a mood of uncertainty and apprehension
which set in with the present century and became marked after 1914. The first British
historian to sound this note after a long interval appears to have been Bury, who, in an
article of 1909 on 'Darwinism in History', drew attention to 'the element of chance
coincidence' which in large measure 'helps to determine events in social evolution'; and a
separate article was devoted to this theme in 1916 under the title 'Cleopatra's Nose'.' H. A.
L. Fisher, in the passage already quoted, which reflects his disillusionment over the failure
of liberal dreams after the First World War, begs his readers to recognise 'the play of the
contingent and the unforeseen' in history."    

"The craving for an interpretation of history is so deep-rooted that, unless we have a
constructive outlook over the past, we are drawn either to mysticism or to cynicism."   

"Consider how that past ages of eternal time before our birth were no concern
of ours. This is a mirror which nature holds up to us of future time after our
death.' Poetic visions of a brighter future took the form of visions of a
return to a golden age of the past - a cyclical view which assimilated the
processes of history to the processes of nature. History was not going
anywhere: because there was no sense of the past, there was equally no sense of
the future. Only Virgil, who in his fourth eclogue had given the classical
picture of a return to the golden age, was inspired in the Aeneid momentarily
to break through the cyclical conception: *'Imperium sine fine dedi'* was a most
unclassical thought, which later earned Virgil recognition as a quasi-Christian
prophet.  

It was the Jews, and after them the Christians, who introduced an entirely new
element by postulating a goal towards which the historical process is moving -
the teleological view of history. History thus acquired a meaning and purpose,
but at the expense of losing its secular character. The attainment of the goal
of history would automatically mean the end of history : history itself became
a theocracy. This was the medieval view of history. The Renaissance restored
the classical view of an anthropocentric world and of the primacy of reason,
but for the pessimistic classical view of the future substituted an optimistic
view derived from the Jewish-Christian tradition. Time, which had once been
hostile and corroding, now became friendly and creative: contrast Horace's
*'Damnosa quid non imminuit dies?* with Bacon's *'Veritas temporis filia'*. The
rationalists of the Enlightenment, who were the founders of modern
historiography, retained the Jewish-Christian teleological view, but
secularized the goal; they were thus enabled to restore the rational character
of the historical process itself."   

"I am more attracted by one of those fascinating glimpses which Mr A.
J. P. Taylor sometimes gives us into Oxford academic life. All this talk about the decline
of civilisation, he writes, ‘means only that university professors used to have domestic
servants and now do their own washing- up'."   

"It is significant that almost all our latter-day prophets of
decline, our sceptics who see no meaning in history and assume that progress is dead,
belong to that sector of the world and to that class of society which have triumphantly
played a leading and predominant part in the advance of civilisation for several
generations."   

"The people who struggle, say, to extend civil rights to all, or to reform
penal practice, or to remove inequalities of race or wealth, are consciously seeking to do
just those things: they are not consciously seeking to 'progress', to realise some historical
'law' or 'hypothesis' or progress. It is the historian who applies to their actions his
hypothesis of progress, and interprets their actions as progress. But this does not invalidate
the concept of progress."   

"The status of reason in Professor Popper's scheme of
things is, in fact, rather like that of a British civil servant, qualified to administer the
policies of the government in power and even to suggest practical improvements to make
them work better, but not to question their fundamental presuppositions or ultimate
purposes. This is useful work: I, too, have been a civil servant in my day. But this
subordination of reason to the assumptions of the existing order seems to me in the long
run wholly unacceptable. This is not how Acton thought of reason when he propounded
his equation revolution = liberalism = reign of ideas. Progress in human affairs, whether in
science or in history or in society, has come mainly through the bold readiness of human
beings not to confine themselves to seeking piecemeal improvements in the way things are
done, but to present fundamental challenges in the name of reason to the current way of
doing things and to the avowed or hidden assumptions on which it rests. I look forward to
a time when the historians and sociologists and political thinkers of the English-speaking
world will regain their courage for that task.   

It is, however, not the waning of faith in reason among the intellectuals and the political
thinkers of the English-speaking world which perturbs me most, but the loss of the
pervading sense of a world in perpetual motion. This seems at first sight paradoxical for
rarely has so much superficial talk been heard changes going on around us. But the
significant thing is that change is no longer thought of as achievement, as opportunity, as
progress, but as an object of fear. When our political and economic pundits prescribe, they
have nothing to offer us but the warning to mistrust radical and far-reaching ideas, to shun
anything that savours of revolution, and to advance - if advance we must - as slowly and
cautiously as we can. At a moment when the world is changing its shape more rapidly and
more radically than at any time in the last 400 years, this seems to me a singular blindness,
which gives ground for apprehension not that the world-wide movement will be stayed,
but that this country - and perhaps other English-speaking countries - may lag behind the
general advance, and relapse helplessly and uncomplainingly into some nostalgic
backwater. For myself, I remain an optimist; and when Sir Lewis Namier warns me to
eschew programmes and ideals, and Professor Oakeshott tells me that we are going
nowhere in particular and that all that matters is to see that nobody rocks the boat, and
Professor Popper wants to keep that dear old T-model on the road by dint of a little
piecemeal engineering, and Professor Trevor-Roper knocks screaming radicals on the
nose, and Professor Morison pleads for history written in a sane conservative spirit, I shall
look out on a world in tumult and a world in travail, and shall answer in the well worn
words of a great scientist: 'And yet - it moves.'"
