Due to the prolific number of footnotes that Michael's article contains, the
essay will simply be linked to here. It is an important walk through the
trajectories that various essentialist concepts have taken in the course of modern
Northern American history. What surprised me most was this quasi-progess --- where
it appears that the concept of race has been disposed of, it's kernel is
carried over into a different, yet sadly, familial form.
