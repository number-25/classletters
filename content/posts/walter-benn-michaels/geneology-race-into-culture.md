## Anti-Imperial Americanism 

Thomas Nelson Page's Red Rock was published in 1898, the year in which the
United States annexed Hawaii, went to war in Cuba, seized the Philippines from
Spain, and emerged as an imperial power. Needless to say, Red Rock, written the
year before these events took place and written about events that had
themselves taken place some thirty years earlier, is unconcerned with Cuba or
the Philippines. But it is not unconcerned with American imperialism; indeed,
American imperialism and, above all, the resistance to it, is its main subject.
Red Rock tells the story of a conquered people, of how they survived under
occupation, and of how they eventually "reconquered" what it sometimes refers
to as their "country" and sometimes as their "section." It is, in short, an
anti-imperialist novel. In the years immediately after its publication, a good
many other similarly anti-imperialist novels appeared, most notably Thomas
Dixon's The Leopard's Spots (1902) and The Clansman (1905).[^2] Like Red Rock,
they are set in the Reconstruction South and make no mention of Cuba or the
Philippines.3 But they are nevertheless importantly marked by the
anti-imperialist arguments that had been invoked against McKinley, in particuar
by the description of the campaign in the Philippines as "a war of conquest"
and by the claim that the president had no authority to "govern any person
anywhere outside the constitution"[^4]: "The constitution," insisted Chicago
reformer Edwin Burritt Smith, "makes no provision for the forcible intervention
by our government in the affairs of a people who do not form an integral part
of our union." More important still, "To the extent we permit our chosen
representatives to exercise arbitrary powers, whetherat homeor abroad, we allow
them to sap and destroy representative government itself."[^5] McKinley's
commitment to governing the Philippines "unfettered by constitutional
restraint" was thus seen as an attack not merely on Filipino rights but on
American rights, on "the very principles for the maintenance of which our
fathers pledged their lives."[^6] Hence Lincoln, in The Clansman, asserting
that his first postwar "duty is to reestablish the Constitution as our supreme
law over every inch of our soil" (C, p. 43), denies that the Civil War was "a
war of conquest" (C, p. 44)7 and refuses to establish martial law or to enforce
"Negro suffrage" in North Carolina: "The Constitution," he says, "grants to the
National Government no power to regulate suffrage, and makes no provision for
the control of 'conquered' provinces" (C, p. 42). And hence his radical
Republican enemy Stoneman (Thaddeus Stevens) wishes to make the "Negro" "the
ruler" and condemns the Constitution as "the creation, both in letter and
spirit, of the slaveholders of the South" (C, p. 43).  Thus, although the major
anti-imperialist literature of the turn of the century made no mention of the
major imperialist adventures of the turn of the century, it did not fail to
address the issues raised by those adventures. Rather it understood those
issues as having essentially to do with the nature of American self-government
and American citizenship "Nation or Empire?"was the question posed by the anti-imperialists.[^8] The
return to Reconstruction for the answer to this question placed anti-
imperialism at the heart of an emerging discourse of American national,
racial, and, eventually, cultural identity. Texts like Red Rock, I will argue,
sought to avoid the perils of empire by avoiding the perils of nationhood
first; for Page and for the plantation tradition more generally, the South
was a "Region" rather than a political entity. In Red Rock, no government
can quite be legitimate, and this refusal of legitimacy is connected with a
comparative indifference to racial identity (signaled by a feudal identification with the Indian) and an insistence on the importance of the family.
For Progressives like Dixon, however, citizenship in the "new nation," pro-
duced out of resistance to an "African" empire, became essentially racial;
the legitimacy of the state (its identity as nation rather than empire) was
guaranteed by its whiteness. (This is why in Red Rock, where whiteness
doesn't yet have any real meaning, the state cannot be legitimated -- the
choice there is between the illegitimate government and the "tribe.")
Then in the 1920s, as whiteness becomes a culture, the Indian and the
family reappear, first as models for a nativist Americanism (Willa Cather)
and second as models for a pluralism of native cultures (Oliver La Farge,
Anzia Yezierska). It is through this pluralism that what I will describe as
the rescue of race by culture is made possible. Thus, I will argue first that
anti-imperialism promoted racial identity to an essential element of Amer-
ican citizenship; second, that this promotion made possible the emergence
of a new cultural and multicultural Americanism; and, third, that our cur-
rent notion of cultural identity both descends from and extends the ear-
lier notion of racial identity.
