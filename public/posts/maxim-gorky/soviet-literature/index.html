    <p>
        <p>THE ROLE of the labour processes, which have converted a two-Legged animal into
man and created the basic elements of culture, has never been investigated as
deeply and thoroughly as it deserves. This is quite natural, for such research
would not be in the interests of the exploiters of labour. The latter, who use
the energy of the masses as a sort of raw material to be turned into money,
could not, of course, enhance the value of this raw material. Ever since remote
antiquity, when mankind was divided into slaves and slave-owners, they have
used the vital power of the toiling mass in the same way as we today use the
mechanical force of river currents. Primitive man has been depicted by the
historians of culture as a philosophizing idealist and mystic, a creator of
gods, a seeker after <em>“the meaning of life.”</em> Primitive man has been saddled with
the mentality of a Jacob Böhme, a cobbler who lived at the end of the sixteenth
and the beginning of the seventeenth century and who occupied himself between
whiles with philosophy of a kind extremely popular among bourgeois mystics;
Böhme preached that <em>“Man should meditate on the Skies, on the Stars and the
Elements, and on the Creatures which do proceed from them, and likewise on the
Holy Angels, the Devil, Heaven and Hell.&quot;</em></p>
<p>You know that the material for the history of primitive culture was furnished
by archaeological data and by the reflections of ancient religious cults, while
the elucidation and study of these survivals have been carried on under the
influence of Christian philosophical dogma, to which even atheist historians
have been no strangers. This influence may be clearly traced in Spencer’s
theory of super-organic evolution, and not in his works alone, but also in
those of Frazer and many others. But no historian of primitive and ancient
culture has used the material of folklore, the unwritten compositions of the
people, the testimony of mythology, which, taken as a whole, is a reflection in
broad artistic generalizations of the phenomena of nature, of the struggle with
nature and of social life.</p>
<p>It is very hard to conceive of a two-legged animal, who spent all his strength
in the struggle for existence, thinking in abstraction from the processes of
labour, from questions of clan and tribe. It is difficult to conceive an
Immanuel Kant, barefoot and clothed in an animal’s skin, cogitating on the
<strong>“thing-in-itself.”</strong> Abstract thought was indulged in by man at a later period,
by that solitary man of whom Aristotle in his Politics said: <em>“Man outside
society is either a god, or a beast.”</em> Being a beast, he sometimes compelled
recognition as a god, but as a beast, he served as the material for the
creation of numerous myths about beast-like men, just as the first men who
learned to ride on horseback furnished the basis for the centaur myth.</p>
<p>The historians of primitive culture have completely waived the clear evidence
of materialist thought, to which the processes of labour and the sum total of
phenomena in the social life of ancient man inevitably gave rise. These
evidences have come down to us in the shape of fables and myths in which we
hear the echo of work done in the taming of animals, in the discovery of
healing herbs, in the invention of implements of labour. Even in remote
antiquity men dreamed of being able to fly in the air, as can be seen from the
legend about Phaethon, about Daedalus and his son Icarus, and also from the
fable of the <strong>“magic carpet.”</strong> Men dreamed of speedier movement over the earth –
hence the fable of the “seven-league boots.” They learned to ride the horse.
The desire to navigate rivers faster than the current led to the invention of
the oar and the sall. The striving to kill enemy and beast from a distance
prompted the invention of the sling, of the bow and arrow. Men conceived the
possibility of spinning and weaving a vast amount of fabric in one night, of
building overnight a good dwelling, even a <strong>“castle,”</strong> that is, a dwelling
fortified against the enemy. They created the spinning wheel, one of the most
ancient instruments of labour; they created the primitive hand loom, and also
the legend of Vassllisa the Wise. It would be possible to produce many more
proofs to show that all these ancient tales and myths contained a purpose, to
show how far-sighted were the fanciful, hypothetical, but already technological
thoughts of primitive man, which could rise to such hypotheses of our own day
as that of using the force of the earth’s revolution around its own axis, or of
breaking up the polar ice. All the myths and legends of ancient times find
their consummation, as it were, in the Tantalus myth. Tantalus stands up to his
neck in water, he is racked by thirst, but unable to allay it – there you have
ancient man amid the phenomena of the outer world, which he has not yet learned
to know.</p>
<p>I do not doubt that you are familiar with ancient legends, tales and myths, but
I should like their fundamental meaning to be more deeply comprehended. And
their meaning is the aspiration of ancient working people to lighten their
toll, increase its productiveness, to arm against four-footed and two-footed
foes, and also by the power of words, by the device of <strong>“exorcism”</strong> and
<strong>“incantation,”</strong> to gain an influence over the elemental phenomena of nature,
which are hostile to men. The last-named is particularly important, as it
betokens how deeply men believed in the power of the word, and this belief is
accounted for by the obvious and very real service of speech in organizing the
social relations and labour processes of men. <strong>“Incantations”</strong> were even used to
influence the gods. This is quite natural, as all the ancient gods lived on the
earth, bore human shape and behaved like men; they were benevolent to the
humble, hostile to the recalcitrant; like men, they were envious, vengeful,
ambitious. The fact that man created god in his own image goes to prove that
religious thought had its origin not in the contemplation of nature, but in
social strife. We are quite justified in believing that the raw material for
the fabrication of gods was furnished by the <strong>“illustrious men”</strong> of ancient days.
Thus, Hercules, the <strong>“hero of labour,”</strong> the <strong>“master of all trades,”</strong> was
ultimately exalted to the seat of the gods, Olympus.</p>
<p>God, in the conception of primitive man, was not an abstract concept, a
fantastic being; but a real personage, armed with some implement of labour,
master of some trade, a teacher and fellow-worker of men. God was the artistic
generalization of the achievements of labour, and the <strong>“religious”</strong> thought of
the tolling masses should be placed in quotation marks, since it represented a
purely artistic creativeness. In idealizing the abilities of men, and having,
as it were, a premonition of their mighty future development, mythology was,
fundamentally speaking, realistic. Beneath each flight of ancient fancy it is
easy to discover the hidden motive, and this motive is always the striving of
men to lighten their labour. It is obvious that this striving originated among
men who had to perform physical labour. And it is obvious, too, that god would
not have made his appearance and would not have continued so long in the daily
lives of men of toil, had he not been so doubly useful to the lords of the
earth, the exploiters of labour. The reason why god is so quickly and easily
failing into disuse in our country is just because the reason for his existence
has disappeared – the need to vindicate the power of man over man, for man
should be only a fellow-worker, a friend, companion, teacher to his fellow-man,
not the master over his mind and will.</p>
<p>But the more powerful and masterful the slave-owner grew, the higher in the
heavens did the gods rise, and among the masses there appeared a desire to
combat god, personified in the image of Prometheus, the Esthonian Kalevi and
other heroes, who saw god as a hostile lord of lords.</p>
<p>Pre-Christian pagan folklore has not preserved any clearly expressed
indications of the existence of thought on <strong>“fundamentals,”</strong> on <strong>“first causes,”</strong>
on the <strong>“thing-in-itself.”</strong> In general it has left no signs of that way of
thinking which was organized into a system in the fourth century before our era
by the “prophet of Attica,” Plato, the founder of a philosophy of abstract
aloofness from the processes of labour, from the conditions and phenomena of
life. It is well known that the church recognized Plato as a forerunner of
Christianity. It is well known that the church, from its inception, stubbornly
fought against the <strong>“survivals of paganism”</strong> – survivals which are a reflection
of the materialist outlook of labour. It is well known that as soon as the
feudal lords began to feel the strength of the bourgeoisie, there arose the
idealist philosophy of Bishop Berkeley, the reactionary nature of which was
exposed by Lenin in his militant book against idealism<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It is well known
that on the eve of the French Revolution, at the end of the eighteenth century,
the bourgeoisie availed itself of the materialist idea in order to fight
feudalism and its inspirer-religion, but that, having conquered its class foe,
and in fear of its new enemy, the proletariat, it immediately reverted to the
idealist doctrine and sought the protection of the church. During the course of
the nineteenth century, the bourgeoisie, feeling with varying degrees of alarm
how iniquitous and precarious was its power over the masses of the toiling
people, tried to vindicate its existence by the philosophy of criticism,
positivism, rationalism, pragmatism and other attempts to distort the purely
materialist thought emanating from the processes of labour. These attempts
revealed, one by one, their powerlessness to <strong>“explain” the world</strong>, and in the
twentieth century we find that the reputed leader of philosophical thought is
the idealist Bergson, whose teaching, by the way, is <strong>“favourable to the
Catholic religion.”</strong> Here you have a definite admission of the need for
regression. Add to this the present. wailings of the bourgeoisie concerning the
disastrous portent of the irresistible growth of technique, which has created
fantastic riches for the capitalists, and you will obtain a pretty clear idea
of the degree of intellectual pauperism to which the bourgeoisie has fallen,
and of the necessity of destroying it as a historical relic which, in decay, is
contaminating the world with the cadaveric poison of its decomposition. The
cause of intellectual impoverishment is always to be found in a refusal to
recognize the basic meaning of real phenomena, in an escape from life through
fear of it, or through an egotistical craving for quiet, through social
indifference created by the sordid and loathsome anarchism of the capitalist
state.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is every ground for hoping that when the history of culture will have
been written by the Marxists, we shall see that the role of the bourgeoisie in
the process of cultural creation has been greatly exaggerated, especially in
literature, and still more so in painting, where the bourgeoisie has always
been the employer, and, consequently, the law-giver. The bourgeoisie has never
had any proclivity towards the creation of culture – if this term be understood
in a broader sense than as a mere steady development of the exterior material
amenities of life and the growth of luxury. The culture of capitalism is
nothing but a system of methods aimed at the physical and moral expansion and
consolidation of the power of the bourgeoisie over the world, over men, over
the treasures of the earth and the powers of nature. The meaning of the process
of cultural development was never understood by the bourgeoisie as the need for
the development of the whole mass of humanity. It is a well known fact that, by
virtue of bourgeois economic policy, every nation organized as a state became
hostile to its neighbours, while the less well organized races, especially the
coloured peoples, served the bourgeoisie as slaves, disfranchised to an even
greater extent than the bourgeoisie’s own white-skinned slaves.</p>
<p>The peasants and the workers were deprived of the right to education – the
right to develop the mind and will towards comprehension of life, towards
altering the conditions of life, towards rendering their working surroundings
more tolerable. The schools trained and are still training no one but obedient
servants of capitalism, who believe in its inviolability and legitimacy. The
need for “educating the people” was talked of and written about, and the
progress of literacy was even boasted of, but in actual fact the working people
were only being split up, imbued with the idea of incompatible distinctions
between races, nations and religions. This doctrine is used to justify an
inhuman colonial policy, which gives an ever wider scope to the insane lust for
profit, to the idiotic greed of shopkeepers. This doctrine has been upheld by
bourgeois science, which has even sunk so low as to assert that a negative
attitude on the part of people of the Aryan race towards all others <em>“has grown
organically out of the metaphysical activity of the whole nation”</em> – although it
is quite obvious that if <strong>“the whole nation”</strong> has become infected with an
infamous animal hostility towards the coloured races or the Semites, this
infection has been engrafted on it in an actual, physical sense by the foul
work of the bourgeoisie, wielding fire and sword. If we remember that the
Christian church has turned this work into a symbol of the suffering of the
loving son of god, the grim humour of it is exposed with disgusting
transparency. We may note in passing that Christ, <strong>“the son of god,”</strong> is the only
<strong>“positive type”</strong> created by ecclesiastical literature, and this type of one who
vainly seeks to reconcile all life’s contradictions is an especially striking
proof of this literature’s creative feebleness.</p>
<p>The history of technical and scientific discoveries abounds in cases where even
the growth of technical culture has been resisted by the bourgeoisie. These
cases are commonly known, as is also the motive for such resistance, viz., the
cheapness of labour power. It will be argued that technique, nevertheless, has
developed and reached considerable heights. This is indisputable. But this is
due to the fact that technique itself augurs, as it were, and suggests to man
the possibility and necessity of its further development.</p>
<p>I will certainly not attempt to deny that in its time – for example, in regard
to feudalism – the bourgeoisie constituted a revolutionary force and
contributed to the growth of material culture, inevitably sacrificing in the
process the vital interests and forces of the working masses. However, the case
of Fulton shows that the bourgeoisie of France, even after its victory, did not
at once appreciate the importance of steamships in the development of trade and
for self-defence. And this is not the only case which testifies to the
conservatism of the bourgeoisie. It is important that we should grasp the fact
that this conservatism, concealing as it did the anxiety of the bourgeoisie to
strengthen and safeguard its power over the world, placed all kinds of
restrictions in the way of the intellectual growth of the working people; that
this nevertheless led in the end to the birth of a new power in the world – the
proletariat, and that the proletariat has already created a state where the
intellectual growth of the masses is unrestricted. There is only one sphere in
which the bourgeoisie has accepted all technical innovations instantly and
without demur – that is, in the manufacture of instruments for human
destruction. Nobody, I believe, has yet noted the influence which the
manufacture of weapons of self-defence for the bourgeoisie has had on the
general trend of development in the metal-working industry.</p>
<p>Social and cultural progress develops normally only when the hands teach the
head, after which the head, now grown more wise, teaches the hands, and the
wise hands once again, this time even more effectually, promote the growth of
the mind. This normal process of cultural growth in men of labour was in
ancient times interrupted by causes of which you are aware. The head became
severed from the hands, and thought from the earth. Speculative dreamers made
their appearance among the mass of active men; they sought to explain the
.world and the growth of ideas in the abstract, independent of the labour
processes, which change the world in conformity with the aims and interests of
man. Their function at first was, probably, that of organizing labour
experience; they were just such <strong>“illustrious men,”</strong> heroes of labour, as we see
now in our own day, in our country. And then, among these people, the source of
all social ills was born – the temptation of one to wield power over many, the
desire to lead an easy life at the expense of other men’s labour, and a
depraved, exaggerated notion of one’s own individual strength, a notion that
was originally fostered by the acknowledgment of exceptional abilities,
although these abilities were but a concentration and reflection of the labour
achievements of the working collective-the tribe or clan. The severance of
labour from thought is attributed by historians of culture to the whole mass of
primitive mankind, while the breeding of individualists is even credited to
them as a positive achievement. The history of the development of individualism
is given with splendid fullness and lucidity in the history of literature. I
again call your attention, comrades, to the fact that folklore, i.e., the
unwritten compositions of tolling man, has created the most profound, vivid and
artistically perfect types of heroes. The perfection of such figures as
Hercules, Prometheus, Mikula, Selyaninovich, Svyatogor, of such types as Doctor
Faustus, Vassilisa the Wise, the ironically lucky Ivan the Simple and finally
Petrushka, who defeats doctor, priest, policeman, devil and death itself – all
these are images in the creation of which reason and intuition, thought and
feeling have been harmoniously blended. Such a blending is possible only when
the creator directly participates in the work of creating realities, in the
struggle for the renovation of life.</p>
<p>It is most important to note that pessimism is entirely foreign to folklore,
despite the fact that the creators of folklore lived a hard life; their bitter
drudgery was robbed of all meaning by the exploiters, while in private life
they were disfranchised and defenceless. Despite all this, the collective body
is in some way distinguished by a consciousness of its own immortality and an
assurance of its triumph over all hostile forces. The hero of folklore, the
<strong>“simpleton,”</strong> despised even by his father and brothers, always turns out to be
wiser than they, always triumphs over all life’s adversities, just as did
Vassilisa the Wise.</p>
<p>If the notes of despair and of doubt in the meaning of terrestrial existence
are sometimes to be heard in folklore, such notes are clearly traceable to the
influence of the Christian church, which has preached pessimism for two
thousand years, and to the ignorant scepticism of the parasitic petty
bourgeoisie whose existence lies between the hammer of capital and the anvil of
the working folk. The significance of folklore stands out most vividly when we
compare its fantasy, founded on the achievements of labour, with the dull and
ponderous fantasy of ecclesiastical literature and the pitiful fantasy of
chivalrous romances.</p>
<p>The epic and the chivalrous romance are a creation of the feudal nobility;
their hero is the conqueror. It is well known that the influence of feudal
literature was never particularly great.</p>
<p>Bourgeois literature began in ancient times, with the Egyptian <strong>“Tale of the
Thief.”</strong> It was continued by the Greeks and the Romans. It emerged again in the
epoch of knighthood’s decay to take the place of the chivalrous romance. This
is a genuinely bourgeois literature, and its principal hero is the rogue, the
thief, later on the detective, and then again the thief – this time the
<strong>“gentleman burglar.”</strong></p>
<p>From the figure of Till Eulenspiegel, created at the end of the fifteenth
century, that of Simplicissimus in the seventeenth century, Lazarillo de
Tormes, Gil Blas, the heroes of Smollett and Fielding, down to the <strong>“Dear
Friend”</strong> of Maupassant, to Arsène Lupin, to the heroes of <strong>“detective”</strong> literature
in present-day Europe, we can count thousands of books the heroes of which are
rogues, thieves, assassins and agents of the criminal police. This is what
constitutes genuine bourgeois literature, reflecting most vividly the real
tastes, the interests and the practical <strong>“morals”</strong> of its consumers. <em>“It’s an ill
wind that blows nobody good”</em> – and on the subsoil of this literature,
generously manured with every conceivable form of vulgarity, including the
vulgarity of middle-class <strong>“common sense”</strong> have sprung up such remarkable
artistic generalizations as, for instance, the figure of Sancho Panza, the Till
Eulenspiegel of De Coster, and many others of equal worth. One of the best
proofs of the deep class interest shown by the bourgeoisie in the portrayal of
crime is the well-known case of Ponson du Terrail; when this writer, after many
volumes, had at length concluded his story of Rocambole with the death of his
hero, the readers organized a demonstration outside Terrails apartment,
demanding that the novel be continued. Such success had never fallen to the lot
of any of the eminent writers in Europe. The readers received several more
volumes of <strong>“Rocambole”</strong> who was resurrected morally as well as physically. This
is a crude example, but one that has its parallels in all bourgeois literature,
of how a cut-throat and robber is converted into a good bourgeois. The
bourgeoisie read about the dexterity of thieves and the cunning of murderers
with the same relish as they read about the astuteness of detectives. Detective
fiction is to this very day the favourite spiritual food of well-fed persons in
Europe. Moreover, in penetrating into the environment of the semi-starved
working man, this type of literature has been and is one of the causes
retarding the growth of class consciousness; it arouses sympathy for the adroit
thief, it engenders the will to steal, to carry on the guerrilla warfare of
isolated individuals against bourgeois property, and, by emphasizing the paltry
value which the bourgeoisie sets on working class life, it stimulates an
<em>“increase of murders and other crimes against the person&quot;</em>. The fervent
attachment of Europe’s middle classes to crime fiction is corroborated by the
plentiful supply of authors who write such fiction and by the wide circulation
which their books enjoy.</p>
<p>It is an interesting fact that in the nineteenth century, when petty knavery
assumed heroic and imposing dimensions on the stock exchange, in parliament and
in the press, the rogue as a hero of fiction was supplanted by the detective
who, in a world full of patent crimes against the working people, showed
remarkable ingenuity in unravelling mysterious crimes-of the imagination. It
is, of course, no accident that the celebrated Sherlock Holmes should have made
his appearance in England, and it is even less of an accident that side by side
with this detective genius appeared the <strong>“gentleman burglar,”</strong> who dupes the
clever detectives. Those who interpret this change of heroes as a “play of the
imagination” will be mistaken. What the imagination creates is prompted by the
facts of real life, and it is governed not by baseless fantasy, divorced from
life, but by very real causes – such as those, for example, which impel the
<strong>“Left”</strong> and Right politicians in France to play football with the corpse of the
<strong>“gentleman burglar”</strong> Stavisky, while endeavouring to finish the game <em>“in a
draw.”</em></p>
<p>Of all the forms of artistic creation in words, the most powerful in its
influence on people is admitted to be the drama, which reveals the emotions and
thoughts of the heroes in living action on the stage. If we trace the progress
of European drama from the days of Shakespeare, it descends to the level of
Kotzebue, Nestor Kukolnik, Sardou and still lower, while the comedy of Molière
declines to that of Scribe; in our country, after Griboyedov and Gogol, it
disappears almost entirely. Since art depicts people, it might perhaps be
assumed that the decline of the dramatic art points to the decay of strong,
boldly chiselled characters, to the fact that <strong>“great men”</strong> have vanished from
the scene.</p>
<p>However, such types are still living a thriving existence to this day as, for
instance, the scurrilous Thersites in bourgeois journalism, the misanthrope
Timon of Athens in literature, the moneylender Shylock in politics, not to
mention Judas, the betrayer of the working class, and many another figure which
has been splendidly portrayed in the past. From the seventeenth century to our
day this category has grown in quantity and become still more loathsome in
quality. The adventurer John Law is a whippersnapper in comparison with
adventurers of the type of Oustric, Stavisky, Ivar Kreuger and similar
super-swindlers of the twentieth century. Cecil Rhodes and other agents in the
field of colonial pillage are worthy counterparts of Cortez and Pizarro. The
oil kings, the steel magnates and the like are much more appalling and more
criminal than Louis XI or Ivan the Terrible. The little republics of South
America contain figures no less lurid than the condottieri of Italy in the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Ford is not the sole caricature of Robert
Owen. The sinister figure of Pierpont Morgan has no equal in the past, if we
except the ancient monarch into whose throat molten gold was poured.</p>
<p>The types enumerated above do not, of course, exhaust the list of diverse
<strong>“great”</strong> men produced by the bourgeoisie in the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries. These people cannot be denied strength of character, a genius for
counting money, plundering the world, and engineering international massacres
to increase their personal wealth; one cannot deny their amazing shamelessness
or the inhumanity of their diabolically vile work. The realistic criticism and
the high artistic literature of Europe have passed by these people without,
apparently, so much as noticing their existence.</p>
<p>Neither in drama nor in fiction do we find the types of the banker, the
manufacturer or the politician depicted with the strength of art which
literature has displayed in giving us the type of the “superfluous man.” Nor
has literature paid heed to the tragic and all too common fate of the masters
and creators of bourgeois culture – the men of science, the artists, the
inventors in the technical field. It has failed to notice the heroes who fought
to liberate nations from the heel of the foreigner, the dreamers of a
brotherhood of man, people like Thomas More, Campanella, Fourier, Saint Simon
and others. <em>This is not meant as a reproach. The past is not irreproachable,
but there is no sense in reproaching it. It should be studied.</em></p>
<p>What has brought the literature of Europe to the state of creative impotence
which it has revealed in the twentieth century? The liberty of art, the freedom
of creative though have been upheld with passionate redundance; all sorts of
arguments have been produced to show that literature can exist and develop
without reference to classes, that it is not dependent on social politics. This
was bad policy, for it imperceptibly impelled many men of letters to constrict
their observations of real life, within narrow bounds, to abstain from a broad
and many-sided study of life, to shut themselves up <em>“in the solitude of their
soul,”</em> to confine themselves to a fruitless form of <strong>“self-cognition”</strong> by way of
introspection and arbitrary thought, altogether detached from life. It has
turned out, however, that people cannot be grasped apart from real life, which
is steeped in politics through and through. It has turned out that man, no
matter what crotchety ideas he may fabricate in regard to himself, still
remains a social unit, and not a cosmic one, like the planets. And moreover it
has turned out that individualism, which turns into egocentrism, breeds
<strong>“superfluous people.”</strong> It has often been noted that the best, most skilfully and
convincingly drawn hero of European literature in the nineteenth century was
the type of <strong>“superfluous person.”</strong> Literature halted in its development to
depict this type of person. After the hero of labour – the man who, though
technically unarmed, nevertheless had a premonition of his triumphant strength;
after the feudal conqueror – the man who understood that it was easier to take
things away than to make them; after the bourgeoisie’s favourite swindler, its
<em>“teacher in the art of life,”</em> the man who sensed that to steal and defraud was
easier than to work, literature halted in its development, paying no heed to
the glaring figures of the founders of capitalism, the oppressors of mankind,
who are far more inhuman than the feudal nobles, bishops, kings and tsars.</p>
<p>Two groups of writers should be distinguished in the bourgeois literature of
Europe. One group extolled and entertained its class, e.g., Trollope, Wilkie
Collins, Braddon, Marryat, Jerome, Paul de Kock, Paul Féval, Octave Feuillet,
Georges Ohnet, Georges Samarov, Julius Stinde, and hundreds of similar authors.
All these are typical <strong>“good bourgeois”</strong> writers not possessing much talent, but
dexterous and trivial, like their readers. The other group, numbering not more
than a few dozen, consists of those great writers who created critical realism
and revolutionary romanticism. They are all apostates, the <strong>“prodigal sons”</strong> of
their class, aristocrats ruined by the bourgeoisie or scions of the petty
bourgeoisie who tore themselves away from the suffocating atmosphere in which
their class lived. The books of this latter group of European writers possess a
twofold and indisputable value for us: firstly, as works of literature which
are models of technical execution, secondly, as documents which explain the
process of the bourgeoisie’s development and decay, documents drawn up by
apostates of their class, but which elucidate its life, traditions and deeds in
a critical light.</p>
<p>It is not my purpose in this report to give a detailed analysis of the role of
critical realism in European literature of the nineteenth century. Its essence
may be summed up in the struggle against the conservatism of the feudal lords
resuscitated by the big bourgeoisie, a struggle waged by organizing democracy –
i.e., the petty bourgeoisie – on the basis of liberal and humanitarian ideas,
this organizing of democracy being understood by many writers and most readers
as a necessary defence both against the big bourgeoisie and against the ever
more powerful onslaught of the proletariat.</p>
<hr>
<p>You are aware that the exceptionally and unprecedentedly powerful growth of
Russian literature in the nineteenth century repeated – although somewhat late
– all the moods and tendencies of western literature, and in turn influenced
it. The special feature of Russian bourgeois literature may be said to be the
profusion of types of <strong>“superfluous people,”</strong> including such altogether original
types, unfamiliar to European readers, as the <strong>“playboy,”</strong> e.g., Vassily Buslayev
in folklore, Fedor Tolstoy, Michael Bakunin and others in history – the type of
<strong>“contrite noble”</strong> in literature, the crank and <strong>“cross-headed”</strong> person in life.</p>
<p>As in the West, our literature developed in two directions. There was the line
of critical realism, represented by Von-Vizin, Griboyedov, Gogol, etc., down to
Chekhov and Bunin, and the line of purely middle-class literature represented
by Bulgarin, Massalsky, Zatov, Golitsynsky, Vonlyarlyarsky, Vsevolod
Krestovsky, Vsevolod Solovyev down to Leikin, Averchenko and so on.</p>
<p>When the lucky swindler with his ill-gotfen wealth took his place beside the
feudal conqueror, our folklore gave the rich man a companion in the shape of
<strong>“Ivan the Simple,”</strong> an ironical type of personage who achieves riches and even
kingship with the aid of a hunchback horse, which takes the place of the good
fairy of romance.</p>
<p>The church, striving to reconcile the slave to his fate and to strengthen its
power over his mind, sought to comfort him by creating heroes of meekness and
longsuffering, martyrs for <strong>“Christ’s sake.”</strong> They created <strong>“hermits,”</strong> banishing
those for whom it had no use to the wilderness, the forest and the monastery.</p>
<p>The more the ruling class split up, the smaller did its heroes become. There
came a time when the <strong>“simpletons”</strong> of folklore, turning into Sancho Panza,
Simplicissimus, Eulenspiegel, grew cleverer than the feudal lords, acquired
boldness to ridicule their masters, and without doubt contributed to the growth
of that state of feeling which, in the first half of the sixteenth century,
found its expression in the ideas of the <strong>“Taborites”</strong> and the peasant wars
against the knights.</p>
<p>The real history of the toiling people cannot be understood without a knowledge
of their unwritten compositions, which have again and again had a definite
influence on the making of such great works as, for instance, Faust, The
Adventures of Baron Münchhausen, Pantagruel and Gargantua; the Till
Eulenspiegel of de Coster, Shelley’s Prometheus Unbound, and numerous others.
Since olden times folklore has been in constant and quaint attendance on
history. It has its own opinion regarding the actions of Louis XI and Ivan the
Terrible and this opinion sharply diverges from the appraisal of history,
written by specialists who were not greatly interested in the question as to
what the combat between monarchs and feudal lords meant to the life of the
toiling people. The grossly coercive <strong>“propaganda”</strong> employed to urge the
cultivation of the potato has inspired a number of legends and popular beliefs
attributing its origin to the copulation of the devil with a harlot; this is a
deviation in the direction of ancient barbarism, consecrated by the foolish
church idea that <em>“Christ and the apostles did not eat potatoes.”</em> But this same
folklore in our days has raised Vladimir Lenin to the level of a mythical hero
of ancient times, equal to Prometheus.</p>
<p>Myth is invention. To invent means to extract from the sum of a given reality
its cardinal idea and embody it n imagery that is how we got realism. But if to
the idea extracted from the given reality we add – completing the idea, by the
logic of hypothesis – the desired, the possible, and thus supplement the image,
we obtain that romanticism which is at the basis of myth and is highly
beneficial in that it tends to provoke a revolutionary attitude to reality, an
attitude that changes the world in a practical way.</p>
<p>Bourgeois society, as we see, has completely lost the capacity for invention in
art. The logic of hypothesis has remained, and acts as a stimulus only in the
field of the sciences, based on experiment. Bourgeois romanticism, based on
individualism, with its propensity for fantastic and mystic ideas, does not
spur the imagination or encourage thought. Sundered, detached from reality, it
is built not on convincingness of imagery but almost exclusively on the <em>“magic
of words,”</em> as we see in Marcel Proust and his votaries. The bourgeois
romanticists, from Novalis onward, are people of the type of Peter Schlemihl,
<em>“the man who lost his shadow,”</em> and Schlemihl was created by Chamisso, a French
émigré who wrote in Germany in German. The literary man of the contemporary
West has also lost his shadow, emigrating from realities to the nihilism of
despair, as can be seen from Louis Céline’s book, A Journey to the End of the
Night; Bardomu the hero of this book, has lost his country, despises mankind,
call his mother <strong>“bitch”</strong> and his mistresses <strong>“carrion,”</strong> is indifferent to all
crimes, and, having no grounds for <strong>“joining”</strong> the revolutionary proletariat, is
quite ripe for the acceptance of fascism.</p>
<p>Turgenev’s influence on the writers of the Scandinavian peninsula is an
established fact; Leo Tolstoy’s influence on Count Pahlen, Réné Bazin,
Estaunier, Thomas Hardy (in his Tess of the D’Urbervilles) and various other
writers in Europe is commonly acknowledged. And the influence of Dostoyevsky
has been and remains an especially strong one. This influence was admitted by
Nietzsche, whose ideas form the basis of the fanatical creed and practice of
fascism. To Dostoyevsky belongs the credit of having painted with the most
vivid perfection of word portraiture a type of egocentrist, a type of social
degenerate in the person of the hero of his Memoirs from Underground. With the
grim triumph of one who is insatiably taking vengeance for his personal
misfortunes and sufferings, for his youthful enthusiasms, Dostoyevsky in the
figure of his hero has shown the depths of whining despair that are reached by
the individualist from among the young men of the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries who are cut off from real life. This type of his combines within
himself the most characteristic traits of Friedrich Nietzsche and of the
Marquis Des Esseintes, the hero of Huysmans Against the Grain, Le Disciple of
Paul Bourget; and Boris Savinkov, who made himself the hero of his own
composition, Oscar Wilde and Artsybashev’s <strong>“Sanine”</strong> and many another social
degenerate created by the anarchic influence of inhuman conditions in the
capitalist state.</p>
<p>As narrated by Vera Figner, Savinkov argued exactly like the decadents: <em>“There
is no morality, there is only beauty. And beauty is the free development of
personality, the unrestrained unfolding of all that lies within its soul.”</em></p>
<p>We know quite well with what rottenness the soul of bourgeois personality is
burdened!</p>
<p>In a state founded on the senseless and humiliating sufferings of the vast
majority of the people, it is fitting that the creed of irresponsible self-will
in word and action should be the guiding and vindicating principle. Such ideas
as <em>“man is a despot by nature,”</em> that he <em>“likes to be a tormentor,”</em> that he is
<em>“passionately fond of suffering,”</em> and that he envisages the meaning of life and
his happiness precisely in self-will, in unrestricted freedom of action, that
only this self-will will bring him his <strong>“greatest advantage,”</strong> and <em>“let the whole
world perish so long as I can drink my tea”</em> – such are the ideas capitalism has
inculcated and upheld through thick and thin.</p>
<p>Dostoyevsky has been called a seeker after truth. If he did seek, he found it
in the brute and animal instincts of man, and found it not to repudiate, but to
justify. Yes, the animal instincts in mankind cannot be extirpated so long as
bourgeois society contains such a vast number of influences which arouse the
beast in man. The domesticated cat plays with the mouse it has caught, because
the muscles of the beast, the hunter of small swift prey, demand that it should
do so; this play is a training of the body. The fascist who, kicking a worker
under the chin, dislodges his head from the spinal column, is not a beast, but
something incomparably worse – he is a mad animal that should be destroyed, the
same heinous brute as the White officer who cuts stripes and stars out of the
skin of the Red Army man.</p>
<p>It is difficult to understand just what Dostoyevsky was seeking for, but
towards the close of his life he found that that talented and most honest of
Russian men, Vissarion Belinsky, was <em>“the most noisome, obtuse and disgraceful
thing in Russian life,”</em> that Constantinople must be taken away from the Turks,
that serfdom is conducive to <em>“ideal moral relations between the landowners and
the peasants,”</em> and finally acknowledged as his preceptor Constantine
Pobedonostsev, one of the grimmest figures of nineteenth century Russian life.
Dostoyevsky’s genius is indisputable. In force of portrayal his talent is equal
perhaps only to Shakespeare. But as a personality, as a <em>“judge of men and the
world,”</em> he is easy to conceive in the role of a medieval inquisitor.</p>
<p>The reason why I have devoted so much space to Dostoyevsky is because without
the influence of his ideas it would be almost impossible to understand the
volte face which Russian literature and the greater part of the intelligentsia
made after 1905-06 from radicalism and democracy towards safeguarding and
defending bourgeois <strong>“law and order.”</strong></p>
<p>Dostoyevsky’s ideas became popular soon after his speech on Pushkin, after the
breaking up of the Narodnaya Volya party, which attempted to overthrow the
autocracy. Before the proletariat, grasping the great and simple truth of
Lenin, had shown its stern countenance to the world in 1905, Peter Struve
prudently began to persuade the intelligentsia, like a maiden who had chanced
to lose her innocence, to enter into legal marriage with the elderly
capitalist. A marriage broker by profession, a bookworm absolutely devoid of
original ideas, he issued the call in 1901 of <strong>“Back to Fichte”</strong> to the idea of
subservience to the will of the nation personified by the shopkeepers and the
landowners, while in 1907 there was published under his editorship and with his
collaboration a collection of articles entitled Landmarks, where the following
sentence, quoted word for word, may be round: <em>“We should be grateful to the
government for de fending us with bayonets against the wrath of the people.”</em></p>
<p>These vile words were uttered by the democratic intelligentsia in the days when
the bailiff of the landowners, the minister Stolypin, was hanging dozens of
workers and peasants daily. The underlying idea in Landmarks was a reiteration
of the fanatical idea expressed in the seventies by that inveterate
conservative, Constantine Leontiev: <em>“Russia must be chilled,”</em> i.e., all the
sparks of social revolution must be stamped out of her. Landmarks, this
renegades act of the <strong>“Constitutional-Democrats,”</strong> won the high approval of the
old renegade Leo Tikhomirov, who called it <em>“the sobering of the Russian soul
and the revival of conscience.”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The period from 1907 to 1917 was a time when irresponsible ideas ran riot, when
Russian men of letters enjoyed complete <strong>“freedom of creation.”</strong> This liberty
found its expression in propaganda of all the conservative ideas of the Western
bourgeoisie – ideas which gained currency after the French Revolution at the
end of the eighteenth century and which flared up again at regular intervals
after 1848 and 1871. It was announced that <em>“the philosophy of Bergson marks a
tremendous step forward in the history of human thought,”</em> that Bergson
<em>“replenished and deepened the theory of Berkeley,”</em> that <em>“the systems of Kant,
Leibnitz, Descartes, and Hegel are dead systems, and the works of Plato, like
the sun, shine above them in eternal beauty”</em> – this of Plato, who founded the
most pernicious of all fallacies of thought, utterly detached from hard
reality, which is continually unfolding in all its aspects in the processes of
labour and creation.</p>
<p>Dmitri Merezkovski, a writer of influence in his time, cried:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Come what may – ‘tis all the same!  Long they’ve wearied of the game, The
three Fates, the eternal Parces – Dust to dust and ash to, ashes!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sologub, following Schopenhauer, and in obvious dependence on Baudelaire and
<strong>“the damned,”</strong> gave a remarkably lucid picture of <em>“the cosmic fatuity of the
existence of personality,”</em> and though he plaintively moaned over this in rhyme,
he nevertheless went on living a comfortable, bourgeois existence, and in 1914
threatened the Germans to destroy Berlin as soon as <em>“the snow vanishes from the
valleys.”</em> The gospel of <strong>“Eros in politics,”</strong> of <strong>“mystical anarchism”</strong> was
preached. Crafty Vassily Rozanov preached eroticism, Leonid Andreyev wrote
nightmare stories and plays, Artsybashev selected as the hero of his novel a
lascivious two legged goat in trousers, and altogether, the decade of 1907-17
fully deserves to be branded as the most shameful and shameless decade in the
history of the Russian intelligentsia.</p>
<p>As our democratic intellectuals were less disciplined by history than those in
the West, the process of their “moral” disintegration, of their intellectual
impoverishment, was more rapid in our country. But this process is common to
the petty bourgeoisie of all countries and unavoidable for every intellectual
who lacks the strength and determination to throw in his lot with the mass of
the proletariat, whose historical mission is to change the world for the common
benefit of all honestly working people.</p>
<p>It should be added that Russian literature, like its Western counterpart,
neglected the landowners, the promotors of industry and the financiers in the
period preceding the revolution, although this category of person offered far
more colourful and original types in our country than in the West. Russian
literature overlooked such nightmare types of landowner as, for instance, the
famous Marlame Saltychikha, General Izmailov, together with scores and hundreds
of similar characters. Gogol’s caricatures and sketches in his book Dead Souls
are not so very characteristic of landed, feudal Russia. The Korobochkas,
Manilovs and Petukhs, the Sobakyeviches and Nozdrevs influenced the policy of
tsarist autocracy merely by the passive fact of their existence; as
blood-suckers of the peasantry, they are not very typical. There were other
masters and artists of the blood-sucking art, people of dreadful moral aspect,
voluptuaries and aesthetes of cruelty. Their evil deeds have not been noted by
artists of the pen, even by the greatest of them, even those who professed
their love for the muzhik. There is an abundance of characteristic traits that
sharply distinguish our big bourgeoisie from that of the West, the explanation
being that our historically young bourgeoisie, pre-eminently of peasant
extraction, got rich more quickly and easily than did the historically quite
elderly bourgeoisie of the West. Our industrialist, untrained by the severe
competition of the West, retained almost up to the twentieth century the
characteristic traits of the “crank” and the <strong>“playboy,”</strong> induced perhaps by his
own astonishment at the silly ease with which he accumulated millions. One of
these, Peter Gubonin, is described by the well-known Tibetan doctor, P. A.
Badmayev, in his booklet Wisdom in the Russian People, published in 1917. This
entertaining booklet, urging young people to <em>“abjure the writings of the devil
which tempt them with the empty words of liberty, equality and fraternity,”</em>
gives us the following information about Gubonin, the son of a mason and
himself a mason by trade, who became a railroad constructor:</p>
<p><em>“Most venerable old officials of the period of Russia’s emancipation, who still
remember the times of Gubonin, relate the following: Gubonin, appearing at the
Ministry in high, tarpolished boots, in a caftan, with a bag of silver, greeted
the janitors and messengers in the hall, drew silver out of his bag and gave
generously to everybody, bowing low, that they might not forget their- Peter
Ionovich. Then he proceeded to the different Departments and Sub-Departments,
where he left each official a sealed envelope – each according to hisrank –
calling them all by their Christian names and likewise bowing to them. The more
exalted personages he greeted and kissed, calling them benefactors of the
Russian people, and was quickly admitted to the presence of His Excellency.
After Peter Ionovich’s departure from the Ministry, everybody rejoiced. It was
a real holiday, such as could only be compared with Christmas or Easter Day.
Each one counted what he had received, smiled, wore a gay and cheerful look and
was thinking how to spend the rest of the day and night until the following
morning. The janitors in the hall were proud of Peter Ionovich, who came from
their midst; they called him clever and good, and asked each other how much
each had received, but they all concealed it, not wishing to compromise their
benefactor. The petty officials whispered among themselves with deep feeling
that kind Peter Ionovich had not forgotten them either – so clever, agreeable
and honest was he. The high officials, including His Excellency, loudly
proclaimed what a lucid, statesmanlike mind he had, what great benefits he was
bringing to the people and the state, meriting some distinction. He ought to be
invited they said, to the conference dealing with railroad questions, as he is
the only clever man concerned with these matters. And indeed, he was invited to
the most important conferences, where only distinguished personages and
engineers were present, and at such conferences the decisive voice was that of
Gubonin.”</em></p>
<p>This narrative sounds ironical, but it is actually written in sincere praise of
an order of society under which the proud watchword of the bourgeoisie –
<strong>“Liberty, equality, fraternity”</strong> – proved to be nothing more than an empty
phrase.</p>
<p>All that I have Said about the creative impotence of the bourgeoisie, as
reflected in its literature, may seem to be excessively gloomy; and may expose
me to the charge of <strong>“tendencious”</strong> exaggeration. But facts are facts, and I see
them as they are.</p>
<p>It would be silly and even criminal to underestimate the enemy’s strength. We
are all perfectly well aware of the strength of his industrial
technique-particularly that of the war industries, which sooner or later will
be directed against us, but will inevitably provoke a world-wide social
revolution and destroy capitalism. Military experts in the West utter loud
warnings to the effect that war will involve the entire rear, all the
population of the warring countries. It may be presumed that the numerous lower
middle class of Europe who have not yet altogether forgotten the horrors of
the 1914-18 massacre and who are scared by the dread inevitability of a new and
more horrible carnage, will at last realize who it is that will profit by the
coming social catastrophe, who is the criminal that periodically and for the
sake of his own nefarious gain exterminates millions of people that they will
realize this, and help the proletarians to smash capitalism. We may presume
this, but we cannot rely upon its happening, for the jesuit and the craven, the
leader of the philistines, the Social-Democrat, is still living. We must firmly
rely on the growth of the proletariats revolutionary sense of justice, but it
is better still for us to be sure of our own strength and to develop it
ceaselessly. It is one of the most essential duties of literature to develop
the revolutionary self-consciousness of the proletariat, to foster its love for
the home it has created, and to defend this home against attack.</p>
<hr>
<p>Once, in ancient times, the unwritten artistic compositions of the working
people represented the sole organizer of their experience, the embodiment of
ideas in imagery and the spur to the working energy of the collective body. We
should try to understand this. The object our country has set itself is to
ensure the equal cultural education of all units, the equal acquaintance of all
its members with the victories and achievements of labour, aspiring to convert
the work of men into the art of controlling the forces of nature. We are more
or less familiar with the process of the economic-and therefore
political-stratification of people, with the process by which the labouring
people’s right to the free development of their minds is usurped by others.
When the task of interpreting the world became the affair of priests, the
latter could arrogate it to themselves only by giving a metaphysical
explanation of phenomena and of the resistance offered by the elemental forces
of nature to the aims and energies of men of labour. This criminal process of
excluding, debarring millions of people from the work of understanding the
world, initiated in antiquity and continuing down to our own day, has resulted
in hundreds of millions of people, divided by ideas of race, nationality and
religion, remaining in a state of the most profound ignorance, of appalling
mental blindness, in the darkness of superstition and, prejudices of every
kind; The Communist-Leninist Party, the workers and peasants government of the.
Union of Socialist Soviets, which have destroyed capitalism throughout. The
length and breadth of tsarist Russia, which have handed over political power to
the workers and the peasants, and which are organizing a free classless
society, have made it the object of their daring, sage and indefatigable
activity to free the working masses from the age-old yoke of an old and outworn
history, of the capitalist development of culture, which today has glaringly
exposed all its vices and its creative decrepitude. And it is from the height
of this great aim that we honest writers of the Union of Soviets must examine,
appraise and organize our work.</p>
<p>We must grasp the fact that it is the toll of the masses which forms the
fundamental organizer of culture and the creator of all ideas, both those which
in the course of centuries have minimized the decisive significance of labour –
the source of our knowledge-and those ideas of Marx, Lenin and Stalin which in
our time are fostering a revolutionary sense of justice among the proletarians
of all countries, and in our country are lifting labour to the level of a power
which serves as the foundation for the creative activity of science and art. To
be successful in our work, we must grasp and fully realize the fact that in our
country the socially organized labour of semi-literate workers and a primitive
peasantry has in the short space of ten years created stupendous values and
armed itself superbly for defence against an enemy attack. Proper appreciation
of this fact will reveal to us the cultural and revolutionary power of a
doctrine which unites the whole proletariat of the world.</p>
<p>All of us – writers, factory workers, collective farmers still work badly and
cannot even fully master everything that has been made by us and for us. Our
working masses do not yet quite grasp the fad that they are working only for
themselves. This feeling is smouldering everywhere, but it has not-yet blazed
up into a mighty and joyous flame. But nothing can kindle until it has reached
a certain temperature, and nobody ever was so splendidly capable of raising the
temperature of labour energy as is the Party organized by the genius of
Vladimir Lenin, and the present-day leader of this Party.</p>
<p>As the principal hero of our books we should choose labour, i.e., a person,
organized by the processes of labour, who in our country is armed with the full
might of modern technique, a person who, in his turn,. so organizes labour that
it becomes easier and more productive, raising it to the level of an art. We
must learn to understand labour as creation. Creation is a concept which we
writers use all too freely, though we hardly possess the right to do so.
Creation is a degree of tension reached in the work of the memory at which the
speed of its working draws from the reserves of knowledge and impressions the
most salient and characteristic facts, pictures, details, and renders them into
the most precise, vivid and intelligible words. Our young literature can not
boast of possessing this quality. The stock of impressions, the sum of
knowledge of our writers is not large, and there is no sign of any special
anxiety to extend or enrich it.</p>
<p>The principal theme of European and Russian literature in the nineteenth
century was personality, in antithesis to society, the state and nature. The
main reason which prompted personality to set itself against bourgeois society
was an abundance of negative impressions, contradictory to class ideas and
social traditions. Personality felt keenly that these impressions were
smothering it, retarding the process of its growth, but it did not fully
realize its own responsibility for the triviality, the baseness, the
criminality of the principles on which bourgeois society was built. Jonathan
Swift was one in all Europe, but Europe’s bourgeoisie considered that this
satire struck at England alone. Generally speaking, .rebellious personality, in
criticizing the life of its society, seldom and barely realized its own
responsibility for society’s odious practices. And still more seldom was the
prime motive for its criticism of the existing order a deep and correct
understanding of the significance of social and economic causes; more often
criticism was provoked either by a sense of the hopelessness of one’s life in
the narrow iron cage of capitalism, or by a desire to avenge the failure of
one’s life and its humiliations. And it can be said that when personality
turned to the working mass, it did not do so in the interests of the mass, but
in the hope that the working class, by destroying bourgeois society, would
ensure it freedom of thought and liberty of action. I reiterate: .the main and
fundamental theme of pre-revolutionary literature was the tragedy of a person
to whom life seemed cramped, who felt superfluous in society, sought therein a
comfortable place for himself, failed to find it, and suffered, died, or
reconciled himself to a society that was hostile to him, or sank to drunkenness
or suicide.</p>
<p>In our Union of Socialist Soviets, there should not, there cannot be
superfluous people. Every citizen enjoys wide freedom for the development of
his abilities, talents and faculties. One thing only is demanded of
personality: Be honest in your attitude to the heroic work of creating a
classless society.</p>
<p>In the Union of Socialist Soviets the workers and peasants government has
called upon the whole mass of the population to help build a new culture – and
it follows from this that the responsibility for mistakes, for hitches, for
spoilage, for every display of middle-class meanness, for perfidy, duplicity
and unscrupulousness lies on each and all of us. That means our criticism must
really be self-criticism; it means that we must devise a system of socialist
morality as a regulating factor in our work and our relationships.</p>
<p>When narrating facts which mark the intellectual growth of the factory workers
and the transformation of the age old proprietor into a collective farm member,
we writers tend to become mere chroniclers of the bare facts, doing scant
justice to the emotional process of these transformations.</p>
<p>We are still poor observers of reality. Even the landscape of the country has
changed; gone is its motley poverty – the bluish patch of oats, and, alongside
of it, the black strip of ploughed land, the golden ribbon of rye, the green
band of wheat, strips of land overgrown with weeds – the whole many-coloured
sadness of universal dismemberment and disseverance. In our days, vast expanses
of land are coloured a single mighty hue. Above the village and the country
town looms not the church, but huge buildings of public usage; giant factories
glitter with a million panes of glass, while the toy-like little heathen
churches of ancient times speak to us eloquently of the giftedness of our
people as expressed in church architecture. the new landscape that has so
sharply changed the aspect of our land has not found a place in literature.</p>
<p>We are living in an epoch of deep-rooted changes in the old ways of life, in an
epoch of mans awakening to a sense of his own dignity, when he has come to
realize himself as a force which is actually changing the world. Many are
amused to read that people with names like Svinukhin, Sobakin, Kuteinikov,
Popov, Svishchev, etc.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, have changed them to such names as Lensky, Novy,
Partisanov, Dedov, Stolyarov, etc. This is not funny, for it marks precisely
the growth of human dignity; it shows how people are refusing to bear a name or
nickname that is humiliating and reminiscent of the harassed servile past of
their grandfathers and their fathers.</p>
<p>Our literature is not sufficiently attentive to the outwardly petty but
intrinsically valuable signs which show that people are seeing themselves in a
new light, to the processes by which the new Soviet citizen is developing.
Svinukhin quite possibly took his name of Lensky, not from Pushkin’s Eugene
Onegin, but by association with the mass murder of the workers on the Lena
Goldfields in 1912; Kuteinikov may have really been a partisan, while Sobakin,
whose grand father, a serf, may have been exchanged for a dog, really feels
himself <strong>“new.”</strong> To change one’s name before the revolution one had to present a
petition in the <strong>“sovereign name”</strong> of the tsar and when a certain Pevtsov<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
asked for his surname to be changed to that of his mother and grandmother,
Avdotin, the rescript <strong>“traced”</strong> on the petition was: <em>“Mentally deficient.”</em></p>
<p>Recently I heard this fact: a sailor in the German navy, a man with a historic
name, a descendant of the Decembrist Volkonsky, became a fascist.</p>
<p><em>“Why?”</em> he was asked.</p>
<p><em>“Because the officers have been forbidden to strike us,”</em> he replied. Here is a
glaring example of how an hereditary aristocrat, a man of the “blue blood,”
loses his sense of personal dignity.</p>
<p>The growth of the new man can be seen with especial clarity among children, yet
children remain quite outside literature’s sphere of observation. Our writers
seem to consider it beneath their dignity to write about children and for
children.</p>
<p>I believe I will not be mistaken in saying that fathers are beginning to show
more care and tenderness for their children, which, in my view, is quite
natural, as children for the first time in the whole life of mankind are now
the inheritors not of their parents money, houses and furniture, but of a real
and mighty fortune-a socialist state created by the labour of their fathers and
mothers. Never before have children been such intelligent and stern judges of
the past, and I quite believe the fact that was related to me of an eleven
year-old tubercular little girl who said to the doctor in the presence of her
father; pointing her finger at him: <em>“It is his fault that I am ill. Till he was
forty years old, he wasted his health on all sorts of bad women, and then
married mama. She is only twenty-seven, she is healthy, and he – you can see
how miserable he is, and I have taken after him.”</em></p>
<p>There is every reason to expect that such reasoning among children will be no
uncommon thing.</p>
<p>Reality is giving us ever more <strong>“raw material”</strong> for artistic generalizations. But
neither the drama nor the novel has yet given an adequately vivid portrayal of
the Soviet woman, who is distinguishing herself as a free agent in all spheres
where the new socialist life is being built. It is even noticeable that
playwrights are endeavouring to write as few women’s parts as possible. It is
hard to understand why. Though woman in our country is the social equal of man,
and though she is successfully proving the diversity of her endowments and the
breadth of her capacities, this equality is all too frequently and in many ways
external and formal. The man has not yet forgotten, or else he has prematurely
forgotten, that for centuries woman has been brought up to be a sensual
plaything and a domestic animal, fitted to play the part of <strong>“housewife.”</strong> This
old and odious debt of history to half the earth’s inhabitants ought to be paid
off by the men of our country first and foremost, as an example to all other
men. And here literature should try to depict the work and mentality of woman
in such a manner as to raise the attitude towards her above the general level
of accepted middle-class behaviour, which is borrowed from the poultry yard.</p>
<p>Further, I deem it necessary to point out that Soviet literature is not merely
a literature of the Russian language. It is an All-Union literature. Since the
literatures of our fraternal republics, distinguished from ours only by
language, live and work in the light and under the wholesome influence of the
same ideas which unite the whole world of the working people that capitalism
has torn asunder, we obviously have no right to ignore the literary creation of
the national minorities simply because there are more of us than of them. The
value of art is gauged not by quantity but by quality. If we can point to such
a giant as Pushkin in our past history, it does not follow from this that the
Armenians, Georgians, Tatars, Ukrainians, and other peoples are incapable of
producing great masters of literature, music, painting and architecture. It
should be remembered that the process by which the entire mass of the toiling
people is being re-born to <strong>“honest human life,”</strong> to the free creation of a new
history, to the creation of a socialist culture, is developing rapidly
throughout the length and breadth of the Union of Socialist Republics. We can
see already that, with each advance, this process brings out more powerfully
the latent abilities and talents that are concealed in this mass of a hundred
and seventy million people.</p>
<p>I deem it needful, comrades, to communicate to you a letter I have received
from a Tatar writer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The great October Revolution has given us writers of the opressed and
backward nations unlimited possibilities, including the possibility of
appearing in Russian literature with our works, which, it is true, are as yet
far from perfect. As you know, we writers of the national minorities, whose
works are printed in the Russian language, already number tens and even
hundreds. That is one side of the question on the other hand, Soviet literature
in Russian is read today not only by the Russian masses, but by the working
people of all nationalities in our Soviet Union; millions of the rising
generation of all the nationalities are being brought up on it. Thus, Soviet
proletarian literature in the Russian language is already ceasing to be the
exclusive literature of Russian speaking people and people of Russian origin,
and is gradually acquiring an international character even in its form. This
important historical process advances new and unexpected problems and new
demands.
It is highly regrettable that not all writers, critics and editors understand
this. That is why so called approved literary opinion in the great centres
continues to regard us as an “ethnographical exhibit.” Not all publishing
houses like to print us. Some of them often make us feel, when taking our
manuscripts, that we are “overhead charges” or a “compulsory quota” for them,
that they are “deliberately allowing a rebate on the Party’s national policy.”
These “noble gestures” quite justly off end our sense of international unity
and feeling of human dignity. The critics, on the appearance of the work, will
at best let fall a few “kind words” for the author and the book, again not so
much on their merits as out of “respect” for the Leninist-Stalinist national
policy of the Party. This does not educate us either; on the contrary, on some
less experienced comrades it has a “demobilizing” and demoralizing effect. And
then, after a single edition, usually of five thousand copies, all of which are
bought up by lovers of the exotic and the rare in the big cities, we are
relegated to the archives. This practice, apart from the bad moral and material
effects it has for us, blocks our way to the mass reader and leads to
inevitable national restriction. We very naturally would like to hear about our
achievements, if any, about our shortcomings and errors (of which we have more
than others), so as to, be able to avoid them in future and we should like to
become accessible to the mass reader.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Representatives of literature from all the Union republics and autonomous
regions will probably be ready to subscribe to this letter. The historians and
critics of our literature should pay heed to this letter and begin to work in
such a way as may impress upon people in our country that, though they may
belong to different tribes and speak different tongues, each and every one of
them is nevertheless a citizen of the first socialist fatherland in the world.
As for the rebuke levelled at our critics, we must admit it to be just. Our
criticism, especially the newspaper kind, which is most widely read by writers,
is untalented, scholastic and uninstructed in regard to current realities. The
worthlessness of mere book-and-newspaper knowledge is especially glaring in
these days, when real life is changing so quickly, when there is such an
abundance of varied activity. Without possessing or elaborating a single
guiding critico-philosophical idea, employing one and the same quotations from
Marx, Engels and Lenin, the critics hardly ever judge themes, characters and
relations between people by facts which are obtained from a direct observation
of the rushing current of life. There is much in our country and in our work
which Marx and Engels could not, of course, have foreseen. Critics tell the
author: <em>“That is wrong, because our teachers have said so and so in this
connection.”</em> But they are incapable of saying: <em>“That is wrong, because the
facts of reality contradict the author’s statements.”</em> Of all the borrowed ideas
which critics use, they have, apparently, quite forgotten that most valuable
idea expressed by Engels: <em>“Our teaching is not dogma; it is a guide to action.”</em>
Criticism is not sufficiently vital, flexible and alive, and finally the critic
cannot teach the author to write simply, vividly, economically, for he himself
writes long-windedly and obscurely, and, which is still worse, either
perfunctorily or with excessive fervour – the latter when he entertains
personal sympathies for the author or is associated with the interests of a
clique that is afflicted with <strong>“leaderism,”</strong> that contagious philistine disease.</p>
<p><strong>“Leaderism”</strong> is a disease of the times, resulting from the lowered vitality of
philistinism, from the sense of its inevitable downfall in the combat between
capitalist and proletarian, and from fear of destruction – a fear which drives
the philistine to the side he has long been accustomed to regard as physically
the strongest, to the side of the employer, the exploiter of other people’s
labour, the plunderer of the world. Inwardly, <strong>“leaderism”</strong> is the fruit of
effete, impotent and impoverished individualism; outwardly, it takes the form
of such festering sores as, for instance, Ebert, Noske, Hitler and, similar
heroes of the capitalist world. Here, where we are creating a socialist world,
such sores are of course impossible. But we still have a few pustules left
among us as a heritage from philistinism – people who are incapable of
appreciating – the essential distinction between <strong>“leaderism”</strong> and leadership,
although the distinction is quite obvious: leadership, placing a high value on
men’s energy, points the way to the achievement of the best practical results
with the minimum expenditure of forces, while <strong>“leaderism”</strong> is the
individualistic striving of the philistine to overtop his comrade, which can be
done easily enough given a mechanical dexterity, an empty head and an empty
heart.</p>
<p>Too often the place of critics is taken by semi-literate reviewers, who merely
bewilder authors and wound their feelings, but are incapable of teaching them
anything. They fall to notice attempts to resuscitate and restore to currency
certain ideas of <strong>“Narodnik”</strong> literature, and finally-which is most
important-they are not interested in the growth of literature in the various
regions, let alone the whole Soviet Union. It should be mentioned also that
critics do not deal with the public statements of authors in answer to the
question of <strong>“how they write,”</strong> although these statements call for critical
attention.</p>
<p>Self-criticism is necessary, comrades. We are working before the eyes of the
proletariat, which, as it grows more and more literate, is constantly raising
its demands on our art, and, incidentally, on our social behaviour.</p>
<p>Communism of ideas does not coincide with the nature of our actions and the
mutual relations existing among us – relations in which a very grave part is
played by philistine mentality, finding vent in envy, avidity, trivial gossip,
and mutual disparagement.</p>
<p>We have written and continue to write a good deal about philistinism, but no
embodiment of philistinism in a single person, in a single image, has been
given. It is just in a single person that it must be portrayed, and this must
be done as powerfully as in such universal types as Faust, Hamlet, etc.</p>
<p>I would remind you that the philistines are a numerous class of parasites who,
while producing nothing, endeavour to consume and devour as much as they
can-and they do devour it. Battening on the peasantry and the working class,
gravitating always toward the paws of the big bourgeoisie, and sometimes, by
force of pressure from without, passing over to the side of the proletariat,
bringing into its midst anarchism, egocentrism and all the banality which is
the historical concomitant of the philistine, banality of thought which feeds
exclusively on routine facts and not the inspirations of labour – philistinism,
in so far as it has thought and does think at all, has always propagated and
upheld the philosophy of individual growth along the line of least resistance,
has sought a more or less stable equilibrium between the two forces. The
philistine’s attitude towards the proletariat is most forcibly illustrated by
the fact that even the half beggarly peasant, the owner of a miserable plot of
land, despised the factory worker, who was destitute of all property except his
hands. That the proletariat had a head as well, the philistine noticed only
when the proletarians hands came into revolutionary action outside the factory.</p>
<p>Not all weeds are harmful or useless, for many of them yield healing toxins.
Philistinism produces only pernicious toxin. If the philistine did not feel
himself such an insignificant detail in the capitalist machine, he would not
strive so persistently and with such futility to prove his significance and the
freedom of his thoughts, his will, his right to existence, and he would not
have produced in the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries so many
<strong>“superfluous people,”</strong> <strong>“contrite nobles,”</strong> people of the type that is <strong>“neither
peacock nor crow.”</strong></p>
<p>In the Union of Soviets, philistinism has been displaced, driven out of its
lair, out of hundreds of provincial towns, has scattered everywhere and, as we
know, has penetrated even into Lenin’s Party, whence it is forcibly ejected
during every Party purge. Nevertheless, it remains and acts like a microbe;
causing shameful maladies.</p>
<p>The Party leadership of literature must be thoroughly purged of all philistine
influences. Party members active in literature must not only be the teachers of
ideas which will muster the energy of the proletariat in all countries for the
last battle for its freedom; the Party leadership must, in all its conduct,
show a morally authoritative force. This force must imbue literary workers
first and foremost with a consciousness of their collective responsibility for
all that happens in their midst. Soviet literature, with all its diversity of
talents, and the steadily growing number of new and gifted writers, should be
organized as an integral collective body, as a potent instrument of socialist
culture.</p>
<p>The Writers Union is not being created merely for the purpose of bodily uniting
all artists of the pen, but so that professional unification may enable them to
comprehend their corporate strength, to define with all possible clarity their
varied tendencies, creative activity, guiding principles, and harmoniously to
merge all aims in that unity which is guiding all the creative working energies
of the country.</p>
<p>The idea, of course, is not to restrict individual creation, but to furnish it
with the widest means of continued powerful development.</p>
<p>It should be realized that critical realism originated as the individual
creation of <strong>“superfluous people,”</strong> who, being incapable of the struggle for
existence, not finding a place in life, and more or less clearly realizing the
aimlessness of personal being, understood this aimlessness merely as the
senselessness of all phenomena in social life and in the whole historical
process.</p>
<p>Without in any way denying the broad, immense work of critical realism, and
while highly appreciating its formal achievements in the art of word painting,
we should understand that this realism is necessary to us only for throwing
light on the survivals of the past, for fighting them, and extirpating them.</p>
<p>But this form of realism did not and cannot serve to educate socialist
individuality, for in criticizing everything, it asserted nothing, or else, at
the worst, reverted to an assertion of what it had itself repudiated.</p>
<p>Socialist individuality, as exemplified by our heroes of labour, who represent
the flower of the working class, can develop only under conditions of
collective labour, which has set itself the supreme and wise aim of liberating
the workers of the whole world from the man-deforming power of capitalism.</p>
<p>Life, as asserted by socialist realism, is deeds, creativeness, the aim of
which is the uninterrupted development of the priceless individual faculties of
man, with a view to his victory over the forces of nature, for the sake of his
health and longevity, for the supreme joy of living on an earth which, in
conformity with the steady growth of his requirements, he wishes to mould
throughout into a beautiful dwelling place for mankind, united into a single
family.</p>
<hr>
<p>Having said so much about the shortcomings of our literature, it is my duty to
note its merits and attainments. I have neither space nor time here to point
out the vital distinction between our literature and that of the West – that is
a lengthy and laborious task, and will partially be dealt with by Comrade Radek
in his report. I will only say what is quite clear to any dispassionate judge –
namely, that our literature has outstripped the West in novelty of theme, and
would remind you that many of our writers are appreciated in the west even more
highly than in their own country. In 1930, in an article published in the book,
On Literature, I spoke in no uncertain terms and with great joy about our
literary attainments. Four years of arduous work have elapsed since then. Does
this work warrant my giving a higher appraisal of our literature’s achievements
today? It is warranted by the high estimation in which many of our books are
held by our principal reader – the worker and collective farmer. You know these
books, therefore I will not name them. I will only say that we already have a
strong group of artists of the pen, a group that we can acknowledge as the
<strong>“leading”</strong> force in the development of literature.</p>
<p>This group unites the most talented Party writers with the non-Party writers,
and the latter are becoming <strong>“Sovietist”</strong> not in word but in deed, assimilating
ever more profoundly the common meaning for all humanity of the heroic work
which is being done by the Party and the workers and peasant’s Soviet
government. It should not be forgotten that it took Russian bourgeois
literature nearly a hundred years reckoning from the end of the eighteenth
century-to take up a commanding position in life and influence it in some
measure. Soviet revolutionary literature has achieved that influence in the
space of fifteen years.</p>
<p>The high standard demanded of literature, which is being rapidly remoulded by
life itself and by the cultural revolutionary work of Lenin’s Party, is due to
the high estimation in which the Party holds the importance of the literary
art. There has never been a state in the world where science and literature
enjoyed such comradely help, such care for the raising of professional
proficiency among the workers of art and science.</p>
<p>The proletarian state must educate thousands of first class <strong>“craftsmen of
culture,”</strong> <strong>“engineers of the soul.”</strong> This is necessary in order to restore to the
whole mass of the working people the right to develop their intelligence,
talents and faculties – a right of which they have been deprived everywhere
else in the world. This aim, which is a fully practicable one, imposes on us
writers the need of strict responsibility for our work and our social
behaviour. This places us not only in the position, traditional to realist
literature, of <strong>“judges of the world and men,”</strong> <strong>“critics of life,”</strong> but gives us
the right to participate directly in the construction of a new life, in the
process of <strong>“changing the world.”</strong> The possession of this right should impress
every writer with a sense of his duty and responsibility for all literature,
for all the aspects in it which should, not be there.</p>
<p>The Union of Soviet Writers unites 1,500 persons. In ratio to the total
population, we thus have one writer to every hundred thousand readers. This is
not much; the inhabitants of the Scandinavian peninsula at the beginning of
this century had one writer to every 230 readers. The population of the Union
of Socialist Republics is constantly and almost dally demonstrating its
giftedness, but we should not think that we shall soon have 1,500 writers of
genius. Let us hope for fifty. Not to be deceived, let us say five writers of
genius and forty-five very talented ones. I think this figure will do for a
start. In the balance, we get people who are still insufficiently attentive to
realities, who organize their material poorly all work on it carelessly. To
this balance should be added the many hundreds of candidates to the union, and
further, hundreds of <strong>“beginners”</strong> in all the republics and regions. Hundreds of
them are writing, dozens are appearing in print. During 1933-34, in different
towns from Khabarovsk and Komsomolsk to Rostov and Stalingrad, Tashkent,
Voronezh, Kabardino-Balkaria, Tiflis, etc., about thirty symposiums and
almanacs have appeared, filled with the works of local beginners.</p>
<p>It is the duty of critics to judge this work. They still fall to notice it,
though it is high time they did so. This work, whatever its merits, is evidence
of a profound cultural process going on in the mass of the people. In reading
these books, you feel that the authors of the different verses, stories and
plays are worker correspondents and village correspondents. I believe that we
have at least ten thousand young people who aspire to work in literature.
Needless to say, the future Literary Institute will not be able to absorb a
tenth part of this host.</p>
<p>Now I will ask:</p>
<p>Why has the Congress of Writers been organized, and what aims will the future
union pursue? If it is only for the professional welfare of literary workers,
it was hardly worth making such a great fuss about. It seems to me that the
union should make its aim not only the professional interests of writers, but
the interests of literature in general. The union should in some degree assume
guidance over the army of beginners, should organize it, distribute its forces
to different tasks and teach these forces to work on material derived both from
the past and from the present.</p>
<p>Work is being done in our country to bring out a History of Factories and
Plants. It appears that it has been a very difficult job to get highly skilled
writers to help in this work. So far excellent work has been done only by the
poetess Shkapskaya and by Maria Levberg; the others not only do not touch the
raw material, but do not find time even to edit what has already been prepared.</p>
<p>We do not know the history of our past. It is proposed to publish a history of
the former ducal and border towns, from the time of their foundation down to
our own day, and a beginning has already been made. This work is to describe to
us, in sketches and narrative form, life in feudal Russia, the colonial policy
of the princes of Muscovy and the tsars, the development of commerce and
industry; it will present a picture of the exploitation of the peasantry by the
prince, the waywode, the merchant, the petty trader, the church, and conclude
the whole with the organization of the collective farms – the act of complete
and real emancipation of the peasantry from the <strong>“power of the earth,”</strong> from the
yoke of ownership.</p>
<p>We should know the past history of the federal republics. To these and many
other collective works hundreds of literary beginners can be attracted, and
this work will furnish them with the widest scope for self-education, for
raising their proficiency through collective work on raw material and through
mutual self-criticism.</p>
<p>We should know about everything that existed in the past – not in the way it
has already been narrated, but as this illuminated: by the teaching of Marx,
Lenin, Stalin, which is being realized by work in the factories and on the
farms, work which is organized and guided by a new force in history – by the
will and reason of the proletariat of the Union of Socialist Republics.</p>
<p>Such, in my view, is the task of the Writers Union. Our congress should be not
only a report to our readers, not only a parade of our endowments; it should
take upon itself the organization of literature, the training of young writers
on work of nation-wide significance, aimed at a full knowledge of our country’s
past and present.</p>
