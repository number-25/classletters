    <p>
        <p>Published in 1966. The text speaks for itself &ndash; a terrific contextualisation of the National Liberation Movements.</p>
<hr>
<p>If any of us came to Cuba with doubts in our mind about the solidity, strength,
maturity and vitality of the Cuban Revolution, these doubts have been removed
by what we have been able to see. Our hearts are now warmed by an unshakeable
certainty which gives us courage in the difficult but glorious struggle against
the common enemy: no power in the world will be able to destroy this Cuban
Revolution, which is creating in the countryside and in the towns not only a
new life but also — and even more important — a New Man, fully conscious of his
national, continental and international rights and duties. In every field of
activity the Cuban people have made major progress during the last seven years,
particularly in 1965, Year of Agriculture.</p>
<p>We believe that this constitutes a particular lesson for the national
liberation movements, especially for those who want their national revolution
to be a true revolution. Some people have not failed to note that a certain
number of Cubans, albeit an insignificant minority, have not shared the joys
and hopes of the celebrations for the seventh anniversary because they are
against the Revolution. It is possible that others will not be present at the
celebrations of the eighth anniversary, but we would like to state that we
consider the ‘open door’ policy for enemies of the Revolution to be a lesson in
courage, determination, humanity and confidence in the people, another
political and moral victory over the enemy; and to those who are worried, in a
spirit of friendship, about the dangers which many be involved in this exodus,
we guarantee that we, the peoples of the countries of Africa, still completely
dominated by Portuguese colonialism, are prepared to send to Cuba as many men
and women as may be needed to compensate for the departure of those who for
reasons of class or of inability to adapt have interests or attitudes which are
incompatible with the interests of the Cuban people. Taking once again the
formerly hard and tragic path of our ancestors (mainly from Guinea and Angola)
who were taken to Cuba as slaves, we would come now as free men, as willing
workers and Cuban patriots, to fulfill a productive function in this new, just
and multi-racial society, and to help and defend with our own lives the
victories of the Cuban people. Thus we would strengthen both all the bonds of
history, blood and culture which unite our peoples with the Cuban people, and
the spontaneous giving of oneself, the deep joy and infectious rhythm which
make the construction of socialism in Cuba a new phenomenon for the world, a
unique and, for many, unaccustomed event.</p>
<p>We are not going to use this platform to rail against imperialism. An African
saying very common in our country says: “When your house is burning, it’s no
use beating the tom-toms.” On a Tricontinental level, this means that we are
not going to eliminate imperialism by shouting insults against it. For us, the
best or worst shout against imperialism, whatever its form, is to take up arms
and fight. This is what we are doing, and this is what we will go on doing
until all foreign domination of our African homelands has been totally
eliminated.</p>
<p>Our agenda includes subjects whose meaning and importance are beyond question
and which show a fundamental preoccupation with struggle. We note, however,
that one form of struggle which we consider to be fundamental has not been
explicitly mentioned in this programme, although we are certain that it was
present in the minds of those who drew up the programme. We refer here to the
struggle against our own weaknesses. Obviously, other cases differ from that of
Guinea; but our experience has shown us that in the general framework of daily
struggle this battle against ourselves — no matter what difficulties the enemy
may create — is the most difficult of all, whether for the present or the
future of our peoples. This battle is the expression of the internal
contradictions in the economic, social, cultural (and therefore historical)
reality of each of our countries. We are convinced that any national or social
revolution which is not based on knowledge of this fundamental reality runs
grave risk of being condemned to failure.</p>
<p>When the African peoples say in their simple language that “no matter how hot
the water from your well, it will not cook your rice,” they express with
singular simplicity a fundamental principle, not only of physics, but also of
political science. We know that the development of a phenomenon in movement,
whatever its external appearance, depends mainly on its internal
characteristics. We also know that on the political level our own reality —
however fine and attractive the reality of others may be — can only be
transformed by detailed knowledge of it, by our own efforts, by our own
sacrifices. It is useful to recall in this Tricontinental gathering, so rich in
experience and example, that however great the similarity between our various
cases and however identical our enemies, national liberation and social
revolution are not exportable commodities; they are, and increasingly so every
day, the outcome of local and national elaboration, more or less influenced by
external factors (be they favorable or unfavorable) but essentially determined
and formed by the historical reality of each people, and carried to success by
the overcoming or correct solution of the internal contradictions between the
various categories characterising this reality. The success of the Cuban
revolution, taking place only 90 miles from the greatest imperialist and
anti-socialist power of all time, seems to us, in its content and its way of
evolution, to be a practical and conclusive illustration of the validity of
this principle.</p>
<p>However we must recognize that we ourselves and the other liberation movements
in general (referring here above all to the African experience) have not
managed to pay sufficient attention to this important problem of our common
struggle.</p>
<p>The ideological deficiency, not to say the total lack of ideology, within the
national liberation movements — which is basically due to ignorance of the
historical reality which these movements claim to transform — constitutes one
of the greatest weaknesses of our struggle against imperialism, if not the
greatest weakness of all. We believe, however, that a sufficient number of
different experiences has already been accumulated to enable us to define a
general line of thought and action with the aim of eliminating this deficiency.
A full discussion of this subject could be useful, and would enable this
conference to make a valuable contribution towards strengthening the present
and future actions of the national liberation movements. This would be a
concrete way of helping these movements, and in our opinion no less important
than political support or financial assistance for arms and suchlike.</p>
<p>It is with the intention of making a contribution, however modest, to this
debate that we present here our opinion of the foundations and objectives of
national liberation in relation to the social structure. This opinion is the
result of our own experiences of the struggle and of a critical appreciation of
the experiences of others. To those who see in it a theoretical character, we
would recall that every practice produces a theory, and that if it is true that
a revolution can fail even though it be based on perfectly conceived theories,
nobody has yet made a successful revolution without a revolutionary theory.</p>
<p>Those who affirm — in our case correctly — that the motive force of history is
the class struggle would certainly agree to a revision of this affirmation to
make it more precise and give it an even wider field of application if they had
a better knowledge of the essential characteristics of certain colonized
peoples, that is to say peoples dominated by imperialism. In fact in the
general evolution of humanity and of each of the peoples of which it is
composed, classes appear neither as a generalized and simultaneous phenomenon
throughout the totality of these groups, nor as a finished, perfect, uniform
and spontaneous whole. The definition of classes within one or several human
groups is a fundamental consequence of the progressive development of the
productive forces and of the characteristics of the distribution of the wealth
produced by the group or usurped from others. That is to say that the
socio-economic phenomenon ‘class’ is created and develops as a function of at
least two essential and interdependent variables — the level of productive
forces and the pattern of ownership of the means of production. This
development takes place slowly, gradually and unevenly, by quantitative and
generally imperceptible variations in the fundamental components; once a
certain degree of accumulation is reached, this process then leads to a
qualitative jump, characterized by the appearance of classes and of conflict
between them.</p>
<p>Factors external to the socio-economic whole can influence, more or less
significantly, the process of development of classes, accelerating it, slowing
it down and even causing regressions. When, for whatever reason, the influence
of these factors ceases, the process reassumes its independence and its rhythm
is then determined not only be the specific internal characteristics of the
whole, but also by the resultant of the effect produced in it by the temporary
action of the external factors. On a strictly internal level the rhythm of the
process may vary, but it remains continuous and progressive. Sudden progress is
only possible as a function of violent alterations — mutations — in the level
of productive forces or in the pattern of ownership. These violent
transformations carried out within the process of development of classes, as a
result of mutations in the level of productive forces or in the pattern of
ownership, are generally called, in economic and political language,
revolutions.</p>
<p>Clearly, however, the possibilities of this process are noticeably influenced
by external factors, and particularly by the interaction of human groups. This
interaction is considerably increased by the development of means of transport
and communication which as created the modern world, eliminating the isolation
of human groups within one area, of areas within one continent, and between
continents. This development, characteristic of a long historical period which
began with the invention of the first means of transport, was already more
evident at the time of the Punic voyages and in the Greek colonization, and was
accentuated by maritime discoveries, the invention of the steam engine and the
discovery of electricity. And in our own times, with the progressive
domesticization of atomic energy it is possible to promise, if not to take men
to the stars, at least to humanize the universe.</p>
<p>This leads us to pose the following question: does history begin only with the
development of the phenomenon of ‘class’, and consequently of class struggle?
To reply in the affirmative would be to place outside history the whole period
of life of human groups from the discovery of hunting, and later of nomadic and
sedentary agriculture, to the organization of herds and the private
appropriation of land. It would also be to consider — and this we refuse to
accept — that various human groups in Africa, Asia, and Latin America were
living without history, or outside history, at the time when they were
subjected to the yoke of imperialism. It would be to consider that the peoples
of our countries, such as the Balantes of Guinea, the Coaniamas of Angola and
the Macondes of Mozambique, are still living today — if we abstract the slight
influence of colonialism to which they have been subjected — outside history,
or that they have no history.</p>
<p>Our refusal, based as it is on concrete knowledge of the socio-economic reality
of our countries and on the analysis of the process of development of the
phenomenon ‘class’, as we have seen earlier, leads us to conclude that if class
struggle is the motive force of history, it is so only in a specific historical
period. This means that before the class struggle — and necessarily after it,
since in this world there is no before without an after — one or several
factors was and will be the motive force of history. It is not difficult to see
that this factor in the history of each human group is the mode of production —
the level of productive forces and the pattern of ownership — characteristic of
that group. Furthermore, as we have seen, classes themselves, class struggle
and their subsequent definition, are the result of the development of the
productive forces in conjunction with the pattern of ownership of the means of
production. It therefore seems correct to conclude that the level of productive
forces, the essential determining element in the content and form of class
struggle, is the true and permanent motive force of history.</p>
<p>If we accept this conclusion, then the doubts in our minds are cleared away.
Because if on the one hand we can see that the existence of history before the
class struggle is guaranteed, and thus avoid for some human groups in our
countries — and perhaps in our continent — the sad position of being peoples
without any history, then on the other hand we can see that history has
continuity, even after the disappearance of class struggle or of classes
themselves. And as it was not we who postulated — on a scientific basis — the
fact of the disappearance of classes as a historical inevitability, we can feel
satisfied at having reached this conclusion which, to a certain extent,
re-establishes coherence and at the same time gives to those peoples who, like
the people of Cuba, are building socialism, the agreeable certainty that they
will not cease to have a history when they complete the process of elimination
of the phenomenon of ‘class’ and class struggle within their socio-economic
whole. Eternity is not of this world, but man will outlive classes and will
continue to produce and make history, since he can never free himself from the
burden of his needs, both of mind and of body, which are the basis of the
development of the forces of production.</p>
<p>The foregoing, and the reality of our times, allow us to state that the history
of one human group or of humanity goes through at least three stages. The first
is characterized by a low level of productive forces — of man’s domination over
nature; the mode of production is of a rudimentary character, private
appropriation of the means of production does not yet exist, there are no
classes, nor, consequently, is there any class struggle. In the second stage,
the increased level of productive forces leads to private appropriation of the
means of production, progressively complicates the mode of production, provokes
conflicts of interests within the socio-economic whole in movement, and makes
possible the appearance of the phenomena ‘class’ and hence of class struggle,
the social expression of the contradiction in the economic field between the
mode of production and private appropriation of the means of production. In the
third stage, once a certain level of productive forces is reached, the
elimination of private appropriation of the means of production is made
possible, and is carried out, together with the elimination of the phenomenon
‘class’ and hence of class struggle; new and hitherto unknown forces in the
historical process of the socio-economic whole are then unleashed.</p>
<p>In politico-economic language, the first stage would correspond to the communal
agricultural and cattle raising society, in which the social structure is
horizontal, without any state; the second to feudal or assimilated agricultural
or agro-industrial bourgeois societies, with a vertical social structure and a
state; the third to socialist or communist societies, in which the economy is
mainly, if not exclusively, industrial (since agriculture itself becomes a form
of industry) and in which the state tends to progressively disappear, or
actually disappears, and where the social structure returns to horizontality,
at a higher level of productive forces, social relations and appreciation of
human values.</p>
<p>At the level of humanity or of part of humanity (human groups within one area,
of one or several continents) these three stages (or two of them) can be
simultaneous, as is shown as much by the present as by the past. This is a
result of the uneven development of human societies, whether caused by internal
reasons or by one or more external factors exerting an accelerating or
slowing down influence on their evolution. On the other hand, in the historical
process of a given socio-economic whole each of the above-mentioned stages
contains, once a certain level of transformation is reached, the seeds of the
following stage.</p>
<p>We should also note that in the present phase of the life of humanity, and for
a given socio-economic whole, the time sequence of the three characteristic
stages is not indispensable. Whatever its level of productive forces and
present social structure, a society can pass rapidly through the defined stages
appropriate to the concrete local realities (both historical and human) and
reach a higher stage of existence. This progress depends on the concrete
possibilities of development of the society’s productive forces and is governed
mainly by the nature of the political power ruling the society, that is to say,
by the type of state or, if one likes, by the character of the dominant class
or classes within the society.</p>
<p>A more detailed analysis would show that the possibility of such a jump in the
historical process arises mainly, in the economic field, from the power of
the means available to man at the time for dominating nature, and, in the
political field, from the new event which has radically clanged the face of
the world and the development of history, the creation of socialist states.</p>
<p>Thus we see that our peoples have their own history regardless of the stage of
their economic development. When they were subjected to imperialist domination,
the historical process of each of our peoples (or of the human groups of which
they are composed) was subjected to the violent action of an exterior factor.
This action — the impact of imperialism on our societies — could not fail to
influence the process of development of the productive forces in our countries
and the social structures of our countries, as well as the content and form of
our national liberation struggles.</p>
<p>But we also see that in the historical context of the development of these
struggles, our peoples have the concrete possibility of going from their
present situation of exploitation and underdevelopment to a new stage of their
historical process which can lead them to a higher form of economic, social and
cultural existence.</p>
<p>The political statement drawn up by the international preparatory committee of
this conference, for which we reaffirm our complete support, placed
imperialism, by clear and succinct analysis, in its economic context and
historical co-ordinates. We will not repeat here what has already been said in
the assembly. We will simply state that imperialism can be defined as a
worldwide expression of the search for profits and the ever-increasing
accumulation of surplus value by monopoly financial capital, centered in two
parts of the world; first in Europe, and then in North America. And if we wish
to place the fact of imperialism within the general trajectory of the evolution
of the transcendental factor which has changed the face of the world, namely
capital and the process of its accumulation, we can say that imperialism is
piracy transplanted from the seas to dry land piracy reorganized, consolidated
and adapted to the aim of exploiting the natural and human resources of our
peoples. But if we can calmly analyze the imperialist phenomenon, we will not
shock anybody by admitting that imperialism — and everything goes to prove that
it is in fact the last phase in the evolution of capitalism — has been a
historical necessity, a consequence of the impetus given by the productive
forces and of the transformations of the means of production in the general
context of humanity, considered as one movement, that is to say a necessity
like those today of the national liberation of peoples, the destruction of
capital and the advent of socialism.</p>
<p>The important thing for our peoples is to know whether imperialism, in its role
as capital in action, has fulfilled in our countries its historical mission:
the acceleration of the process of development of the productive forces and
their transformation in the sense of increasing complexity in the means of
production; increasing the differentiation between the classes with the
development of the bourgeoisie, and intensifying the class struggle; and
appreciably increasing the level of economic, social and cultural life of the
peoples. It is also worth examining the influences and effects of imperialist
action on the social structures and historical processes of our peoples.</p>
<p>We will not condemn nor justify imperialism here; we will simply state that as
much on the economic level as on the social and cultural level, imperialist
capital has not remotely fulfilled the historical mission carried out by
capital in the countries of accumulation. This means that if, on the one had,
imperialist capital has had, in the great majority of the dominated countries,
the simple function of multiplying surplus value, it can be seen on the other
hand that the historical capacity of capital (as indestructible accelerator of
the process of development of productive forces) depends strictly on its
freedom, that is to say on the degree of independence with which it is
utilized. We must however recognize that in certain cases imperialist capital
or moribund capitalism has had sufficient self-interest, strength and time to
increase the level of productive forces (as well as building towns) and to
allow a minority of the local population to attain a higher and even privileged
standard of living, thus contributing to a process which some would call
dialectical, by widening the contradictions within the societies in question.
In other, even rarer cases, there has existed the possibility of accumulation
of capital, creating the conditions for the development of a local bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>On the question of the effects of imperialist domination on the social
structure and historical process of our peoples, we should first of all examine
the general forms of imperialist domination. There are at least two forms: the
first is direct domination, by means of a power made up of people foreign to
the dominated people (armed forces police, administrative agents and settlers);
this is generally called classical colonialism or colonialism is indirect
domination, by a political power made up mainly or completely of native agents;
this is called neocolonialism.</p>
<p>In the first case, the social structure of the dominated people, whatever its
stage of development, can suffer the following consequences: (a) total
destruction, generally accompanied by immediate or gradual elimination of the
native population and, consequently, by the substitution of a population from
outside; (b) partial destruction, generally accompanied by a greater or lesser
influx of population from outside; (c) apparent conservation, conditioned by
confining the native society to zones or reserves generally offering no
possibilities of living, accompanied by massive implantation of population from
outside.</p>
<p>The two latter cases are those which we must consider in the framework of the
problematic national liberation, and they are extensively present in Africa.
One can say that in either case the influence of imperialism on the historical
process of the dominated people produces paralysis, stagnation and even in some
cases regression in this process. However this paralysis is not complete. In
one sector or another of the socio-economic whole in question, noticeable
transformations can be expected, caused by the permanent action of some
internal (local) factors or by the action of new factors introduced by the
colonial domination, such as the introduction of money and the development of
urban centers. Among these transformations we should anticipate a progressive
loss of prestige of the ruling native classes or sectors, the forced or
voluntary exodus of part of the peasant population to the urban centers, with
the consequent development of new social strata; salaried workers, clerks,
employees in commerce and the liberal professions, and an instable stratum of
unemployed. In the countryside there develops, with very varied intensity and
always linked to the urban milieu, a stratum made up of small landowners. In
the case of neo-colonialism, whether the majority of the colonized population
is of native or foreign origin, the imperialist action takes the form of
creating a local bourgeoisie or pseudo-bourgeoisie, controlled by the ruling
class of the dominating country.</p>
<p>The transformations in the social structure are not so marked in the lower
strata, above all in the countryside, which retains the characteristics of the
colonial phase; but the creation of a native pseudo-bourgeoisie which generally
develops out of a petty bourgeoisie of bureaucrats and accentuates the
differentiation between the social strata and intermediaries in the commercial
system (compradores), by strengthening the economic activity of local elements,
opens up new perspectives in the social dynamic, mainly by the development of
an urban working class, the introduction of private agricultural property and
the progressive appearance of an agricultural proletariat. These more or less
noticeable transformations of the social structure, produced by a significant
increase in the level of productive forces, have a direct influence on the
historical process of the socio-economic whole in question. While in classical
colonialism this process is paralyzed, neo-colonialist domination, by allowing
the social dynamic to awaken (conflicts of interests between native social
strata or class struggles), creates the illusion that the historical process is
returning to its normal evolution. This illusion will be reinforced by the
existence of a political power (national state) composed of native elements. In
reality it is scarcely even an illusion, since the submission of the local
‘ruling’ class to the ruling class of the dominating country limits or prevents
the development of the national productive forces.</p>
<p>But in the concrete conditions of the present day world economy this dependence
is fatal and thus the local pseudo-bourgeoisie, however nationalist it may be,
cannot effectively fulfill its historical function; it cannot freely direct the
development of the productive forces; in brief it cannot be a national
bourgeoisie. For as we have seen, the productive forces are the motive force of
history, and total freedom of the process of their development is an
indispensable condition for their proper functioning.</p>
<p>We therefore see that both in colonialism and in neo-colonialism the essential
characteristic of imperialist domination remains the same: the negation of the
historical process of the dominated people by means of violent usurpation of
the freedom of development of the national productive forces. This observation,
which identifies the essence of the two apparent forms of imperialist
domination, seems to us to be of major importance for the thought and action of
liberation movements, both in the course of struggle and after the winning of
independence.</p>
<p>On the basis of this, we can state that national liberation is the phenomenon
in which a given socio-economic whole rejects the negation of its historical
process. In other words, the national liberation of a people is the regaining
of the historical personality of that people, its return to history through the
destruction of the imperialist domination to which it was subjected.</p>
<p>We have seen that violent usurpation of the freedom of the process of
development of the productive forces of the dominated socio-economic whole
constitutes the principal and permanent characteristic of imperialist
domination, whatever its form. We have also seen that this freedom alone can
guarantee the normal development of the historical process of a people. We can
therefore conclude that national liberation exists only when the national
productive forces have been completely freed from every kind of foreign
domination.</p>
<p>It is often said that national liberation is based on the right of every people
to freely control its own destiny and that the objective of this liberation is
national independence. Although we do not disagree with this vague and
subjective way of expressing a complex reality, we prefer to be objective,
since for us the basis of national liberation, whatever the formulas adopted on
the level of international law, is the inalienable right of every people to
have its own history, and the objective of national liberation is to regain
this right usurped by imperialism, that is to say, to free the process of
development of the national productive forces.</p>
<p>For this reason, in our opinion, any national liberation movement which does
not take into consideration this basis and this objective may certainly
struggle against imperialism, but will surely not be struggling for national
liberation.</p>
<p>This means that, bearing in mind the essential characteristics of the present
world economy, as well as experiences already gained in the field of
anti-imperialist struggle, the principal aspect of national liberation struggle
is the struggle against neo-colonialism. Furthermore, if we accept that
national liberation demands a profound mutation in the process of development
of the productive forces, we see that this phenomenon of national liberation
necessarily corresponds to a revolution. The important thing is to be conscious
of the objective and subjective conditions in which this revolution can be made
and to know the type or types of struggle most appropriate for its realization.</p>
<p>We are not going to repeat here that these conditions are favorable in the
present phase of the history of humanity; it is sufficient to recall that
unfavorable conditions also exist, just as much on the international level as
on the internal level of each nation struggling for liberation.</p>
<p>On the international level, it seems to us that the following factors, at
least, are unfavorable to national liberation movements: the neo-colonial
situation of a great number of states which, having won political independence,
are now tending to join up with others already in that situation; the progress
made by neo-capitalism, particularly in Europe, where imperialism is adopting
preferential investments, encouraging the development of a privileged
proletariat and thus lowering the revolutionary level of the working classes;
the open or concealed neo-colonial position of some European states which, like
Portugal, still have colonies; the so-called policy of ‘aid for undeveloped
countries’ adopted by imperialism with the aim of creating or reinforcing
native pseudo-bourgeoisies which are necessarily dependent on the international
bourgeoisie, and thus obstructing the path of revolution; the claustrophobia
and revolutionary timidity which have led some recently independent states
whose internal economic and political conditions are favorable to revolution to
accept compromises with the enemy or its agents; the growing contradictions
between anti-imperialist states; and, finally, the threat to world peace posed
by the prospect of atomic war on the part of imperialism. All these factors
reinforce the action of imperialism against the national liberation movements.</p>
<p>If the repeated interventions and growing aggressiveness of imperialism against
the peoples can be interpreted as a sign of desperation faced with the size of
the national liberation movements, they can also be explained to a certain
extent by the weaknesses produced by these unfavorable factors within the
general front of the anti-imperialist struggle.</p>
<p>On the internal level, we believe that the most important weaknesses or
unfavorable factors are inherent in the socio-economic structure and in the
tendencies of its evolution under imperialist pressure, or to be more precise
in the little or no attention paid to the characteristics of this structure and
these tendencies by the national liberation movements in deciding on the
strategy of their struggles.</p>
<p>By saying this we do not wish to diminish the importance of other internal
factors which are unfavorable to national liberation, such as economic
under-development, the consequent social and cultural backwardness of the
popular masses, tribalism and other contradictions of lesser importance. It
should however be pointed out that the existence of tribes only manifests
itself as an important contradiction as a function of opportunistic attitudes,
generally on the part of detribalised individuals or groups, within the
national liberation movements. Contradictions between classes, even when only
embryonic, are of far greater importance than contradictions between tribes.</p>
<p>Although the colonial and neo-colonial situations are identical in essence, and
the main aspect of the struggle against imperialism is neo-colonialist, we feel
it is vital to distinguish in practice these two situations. In fact the
horizontal structure, however it may differ from the native society, and the
absence of a political power composed of national elements in the colonial
situation make possible the creation of a wide front of unity and struggle,
which is vital to the success of the national liberation movement. But this
possibility does not remove the need for a rigorous analysis of the native
social structure, of the tendencies of its evolution, and for the adoption in
practice of appropriate measures for ensuring true national liberation. While
recognizing that each movement knows best what to do in its own case, one of
these measures seems to us indispensable, namely, the creation of a firmly
united vanguard, conscious of the true meaning and objective of the national
liberation struggle which it must lead. This necessity is all the more urgent
since we know that with rare exceptions the colonial situation neither permits
nor needs the existence of significant vanguard classes (working class
conscious of its existence and rural proletariat) which could ensure the
vigilance of the popular masses over the evolution of the liberation movement.
On the contrary, the generally embryonic character of the working classes and
the economic, social and cultural situation of the physical force of most
importance in the national liberation struggle &ndash; the peasantry &ndash; do not allow these
two main forces to distinguish true national independence from fictitious
political independence. Only a revolutionary vanguard, generally an active
minority, can be aware of this distinction from the start and make it known,
through the struggle, to the popular masses. This explains the fundamentally
political nature of the national liberation struggle and to a certain extent
makes the form of struggle important in the final result of the phenomenon of
national liberation.</p>
<p>In the neo-colonial situation the more or less vertical structure of the native
society and the existence of a political power composed of native
elements national state already worsen the contradictions within that society
and make difficult if not impossible the creation of as wide a front as in the
colonial situation. On the one hand the material effects (mainly the
nationalization of cadres and the increased economic initiative of the native
elements, particularly in the commercial field) and the psychological effects
(pride in the belief of being ruled by one’s own compatriots, exploitation of
religious or tribal solidarity between some leaders and a fraction of the
masses) together demobilize a considerable part of the nationalist forces. But
on the other hand the necessarily repressive nature of the neo-colonial state
against the national liberation forces, the sharpening of contradictions
between classes, the objective permanence of signs and agents of foreign
domination (settlers who retain their privileges, armed forces, racial
discrimination), the growing poverty of the peasantry and the more or less
notorious influence of external factors all contribute towards keeping the
flame of nationalism alive, towards progressively raising the consciousness of
wide popular sectors and towards reuniting the majority of the population, on
the very basis of awareness of neo-colonialist frustration, around the ideal of
national liberation. In addition, while the native ruling class becomes
progressively more bourgeois, the development of a working class composed of
urban workers and agricultural proletarians, all exploited by the indirect
domination of imperialism, opens up new perspectives for the evolution of
national liberation. This working class, whatever the level of its political
consciousness (given a certain minimum, namely the awareness of its own needs),
seems to constitute the true popular vanguard of the national liberation
struggle in the neo-colonial case. However it will not be able to completely
fulfill its mission in this struggle (which does not end with the gaining of
independence) unless it firmly unites with the other exploited strata, the
peasants in general (hired men, sharecroppers, tenants and small farmers) and
the nationalist petty bourgeoisie. The creation of this alliance demands the
mobilization and organization of the nationalist forces within the framework
(or by the action) of a strong and well-structured political organization.</p>
<p>Another important distinction between the colonial and neo-colonial situations
is in the prospects for the struggle. The colonial situation (in which the
nation class fights the repressive forces of the bourgeoisie of the colonizing
country) can lead, apparently at least, to a nationalist solution (national
revolution); the nation gains its independence and theoretically adopts the
economic structure which best suits it. The neo-colonial situation (in which
the working classes and their allies struggle simultaneously against the
imperialist bourgeoisie and the native ruling class) is not resolved by a
nationalist solution; it demands the destruction of the capitalist structure
implanted in the national territory by imperialism, and correctly postulates a
socialist solution.</p>
<p>This distinction arises mainly from the different levels of the productive
forces in the two cases and the consequent sharpening of the class struggle.</p>
<p>It would not be difficult to show that in time the distinction becomes scarcely
apparent. It is sufficient to recall that in our present historical situation —
elimination of imperialism which uses every means to perpetuate its domination
over our peoples, and consolidation of socialism throughout a large part of the
world — there are only two possible paths for an independent nation: to return
to imperialist domination (neo-colonialism, capitalism, state capitalism), or
to take the way of socialism. This operation, on which depends the compensation
for the efforts and sacrifices of the popular masses during the struggle, is
considerably influenced by the form of struggle and the degree of revolutionary
consciousness of those who lead it. The facts make it unnecessary for us to
prove that the essential instrument of imperialist domination is violence. If
we accept the principle that the liberation struggle is a revolution and that
it does not finish at the moment when the national flag is raised and the
national anthem played, we will see that there is not, and cannot be national
liberation without the use of liberating violence by the nationalist forces, to
answer the criminal violence of the agents of imperialism. Nobody can doubt
that, whatever its local characteristics, imperialist domination implies a
state of permanent violence against the nationalist forces. There is no people
on earth which, having been subjected to the imperialist yoke (colonialist or
neo-colonialist), has managed to gain its independence (nominal or effective)
without victims. The important thing is to determine which forms of violence
have to be used by the national liberation forces in order not only to answer
the violence of imperialism, but also to ensure through the struggle the final
victory of their cause, true national independence. The past and present
experiences of various peoples, the present situation of national liberation
struggles in the world (especially in Vietnam, the Congo and Zimbabwe) as well
as the situation of permanent violence, or at least of contradictions and
upheavals, in certain countries which have gained their independence by the
so-called peaceful way, show us not only that compromises with imperialism do
not work, but also that the normal way of national liberation, imposed on
peoples by imperialist repression, is armed struggle.</p>
<p>We do not think we will shock this assembly by stating that the only effective
way of definitively fulfilling the aspirations of the peoples, that is to say
of attaining national liberation, is by armed struggle. This is the great
lesson which the contemporary history of liberation struggle teaches all those
who are truly committed to the effort of liberating their peoples.</p>
<p>It is obvious that both the effectiveness of this way and the stability of the
situation to which it leads after liberation depend not only on the
characteristics of the organization of the struggle but also on the political
and moral awareness of those who, for historical reasons, are capable of being
the immediate heirs of the colonial or neo-colonial state. For events have
shown that the only social sector capable of being aware of the reality of
imperialist domination and of directing the state apparatus inherited from this
domination is the native petty bourgeoisie. If we bear in mind the aleatory
characteristics and the complexity of the tendencies naturally inherent in the
economic situation of this social stratum or class, we will see that this
specific inevitability in our situation constitutes one of the weaknesses of
the national liberation movement.</p>
<p>The colonial situation, which does not permit the development of a native
pseudo-bourgeoisie and in which the popular masses do not generally reach the
necessary level of political consciousness before the advent of the phenomenon
of national liberation, offers the petty bourgeoisie the historical opportunity
of leading the struggle against foreign domination, since by nature of its
objective and subjective position (higher standard of living than that of the
masses, more frequent contact with the agents of colonialism, and hence more
chances of being humiliated, higher level of education and political awareness,
etc.) it is the stratum which most rapidly becomes aware of the need to free
itself from foreign domination. This historical responsibility is assumed by
the sector of the petty bourgeoisie which, in the colonial context, can be
called revolutionary, while other sectors retain the doubts characteristic of
these classes or ally themselves to colonialism so as to defend, albeit
illusorily, their social situation.</p>
<p>The neo-colonial situation, which demands the elimination of the native
pseudo-bourgeoisie so that national liberation can be attained, also offers the
petty bourgeoisie the chance of playing a role of major and even decisive
importance in the struggle for the elimination of foreign domination. But in
this case, by virtue of the progress made in the social structure, the function
of leading the struggle is shared (to a greater or lesser extent) with the more
educated sectors of the working classes and even with some elements of the
national pseudo-bourgeoisie who are inspired by patriotic sentiments. The role
of the sector of the petty bourgeoisie which participates in leading the
struggle is all the more important since it is a fact that in the neo-colonial
situation it is the most suitable sector to assume these functions, both
because of the economic and cultural limitations of the working masses, and
because of the complexes and limitations of an ideological nature which
characterize the sector of the national pseudo-bourgeoisie which supports the
struggle. In this case it is important to note that the role with which it is
entrusted demands from this sector of the petty bourgeoisie a greater
revolutionary consciousness, and the capacity for faithfully interpreting the
aspirations of the masses in each phase of the struggle and for identifying
themselves more and more with the masses.</p>
<p>But however high the degree of revolutionary consciousness of the sector of the
petty bourgeoisie called on to fulfill this historical function, it cannot free
itself from one objective of reality: the petty bourgeoisie, as a service class
(that is to say that a class not directly involved in the process of
production) does not possess the economic base to guarantee the taking over of
power. In fact history has shown that whatever the role — sometimes important —
played by individuals coming from the petty bourgeoisie in the process of a
revolution, this class has never possessed political control. And it never
could possess it, since political control (the state) is based on the economic
capacity of the ruling class, and in the conditions of colonial and
neo-colonial society this capacity is retained by two entities: imperialist
capital and the native working classes.</p>
<p>To retain the power which national liberation puts in its hands, the petty
bourgeoisie has only one path: to give free rein to its natural tendencies to
become more bourgeois, to permit the development of a bureaucratic and
intermediary bourgeoisie in the commercial cycle, in order to transform itself
into a national pseudo-bourgeoisie, that is to say in order to negate the
revolution and necessarily ally. In order not to betray these objectives the
petty bourgeoisie has only one choice: to strengthen its revolutionary
consciousness, to reject the temptations of becoming more bourgeois and the
natural concerns of its class mentality, to identify itself with the working
classes and not to oppose the normal development of the process of revolution.
This means that in order to truly fulfill the role in the national liberation
struggle, the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie must be capable of committing
suicide as a class in order to be reborn as revolutionary workers, completely
identified with the deepest aspirations of the people to which they belong.</p>
<p>This alternative — to betray the revolution or to commit suicide as a class —
constitutes the dilemma of the petty bourgeoisie in the general framework of
the national liberation struggle. The positive solution in favor of the
revolution depends on what Fidel Castro recently correctly called the
development of revolutionary consciousness. This dependence necessarily calls
our attention to the capacity of the leader of the national liberation struggle
to remain faithful to the principles and to the fundamental cause of this
struggle. This shows us, to a certain extent, that if national liberation is
essentially a political problem, the conditions for its development give it
certain characteristics which belong to the sphere of morals.</p>
<p>We will not shout hurrahs or proclaim here our solidarity with this or that
people in struggle. Our presence is in itself a cry of condemnation of
imperialism and a proof of solidarity with all peoples who want to banish from
their country the imperialist yoke, and in particular with the heroic people of
Vietnam. But we firmly believe that the best proof we can give of our
anti-imperialist position and of our active solidarity with our comrades in
this common struggle is to return to our countries, to further develop this
struggle and to remain faithful to the principles and objectives of national
liberation.</p>
<p>Our wish is that every national liberation movement represented here may be
able to repeat in its own country, arms in hand, in unison with its people, the
already legendary cry of Cuba:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Patria O Muerte, Venceremos!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Death to the Forces of Imperialism!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Free, Prosperous and Happy Country for Each of our Peoples!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Venceremos!</em></p>
</blockquote>
