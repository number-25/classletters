      <description>The Gemeinschaft and the &amp;ldquo;Socialism of War&amp;rdquo; The outbreak of the First World War was perceived by more than just a few European intellectuals as the confirmation of the irreversible crisis, not only of historical materialism, but of every &amp;ldquo;unilateral, natu- ralisric way of thinking and feeling&amp;rdquo; as well &amp;mdash; the expression, we will see, is Husserl&amp;rsquo;s. In the presence of this conflict, considered by a large political press to be a clash of opposed ideals and world visions, even as a reli- gious and holy war, a Glaubenskrieg{^1}, the economic and material approach to the historical world was revealing its bankruptcy.</description>

      <title>Global Neoliberal Practice: Institutions and Regulation in Africa by Graham Harrison</title>

      <description>This is a chapter out of Graham Harrison&amp;rsquo;s Book &amp;ldquo;Neoliberal Africa: The Impact of Global Social Engineering&amp;rdquo;. Although the book is more of an essay containing fragmentary thoughts, I found this chapter substantial in the sense that it clearly outlined the various institutional avenues in which projects such as neoliberalism cement their ideology.
This chapter considers the global emergence of neoliberalism. It looks at the ways in which neoliberal practice has emerged, expanded and established for itself ‘paradigmatic’ status.</description>

      <description>Due to the prolific number of footnotes that Michael&amp;rsquo;s article contains, the essay will simply be linked to here. It is an important walk through the trajectories that various essentialist concepts have taken in the course of modern Northern American history. What surprised me most was this quasi-progess &amp;mdash; where it appears that the concept of race has been disposed of, it&amp;rsquo;s kernel is carried over into a different, yet sadly, familial form.</description>

      <description>Herein is a speech delivered in August 1934, and published in 1935. It reappeared in Gorky, Radek, Bukharin, Zhdanov and others “Soviet Writers’ Congress 1934,” page 25-69, Lawrence &amp;amp; Wishart, 1977, and was transcribed by Jose Braz for the Marxists Internet Archive.
The role of the labour processes, which have converted a two-Legged animal into man and created the basic elements of culture, has never been investigated as deeply and thoroughly as it deserves.</description>

      <title>The Crisis of Bourgeois Philosophy by György Lukács</title>

      <description>Written in 1948.
The fact of the crisis has been stated not only by us Marxists. The concept of “crisis” has long taken root in bourgeois philosophy. When, for example, Siegfried Marck, a famous neo-Hegelian, wanted to define Rickert’s place in the development of philosophy, he called him a thinker of the “pre-crisis era.” Indeed, if we carefully trace the development of bourgeois philosophy in recent decades, we will see that literally every two years the foundations of philosophy are again and again called into question.</description>

      <description>The text here is an extract from Adolph Reed Jr&amp;rsquo;s 2000 work &amp;ldquo;Class Notes&amp;rdquo;. This publication is the founding inspiration for the theme and title of this site here &amp;ndash; long live Reed.
This book is built on commentary about current issues and events in american politics over most of the 1990s. as such, it expresses an on-going attempt to make sense of contemporary american political life from a critical perspective.</description>
