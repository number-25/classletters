      <description>An excerpt from William Lazonick&amp;rsquo;s terrific work &amp;ldquo;Business Organization and the Myth of the Market Economy&amp;rdquo;, a book that offers a critique of what a &amp;lsquo;market economy&amp;rsquo; is purported to be, through an evaluation of the strategies and economic histories of businesses within what can be called &amp;ldquo;actually existing capitalism&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Here, at the risk of a small amount of repetition, I shall supplement that discussion by focusing on the nature of fixed costs, the different sources of uncertainty the innovative organization faces, and the relation between organizational capability and technological change.</description>

      <description>In looking to imagine and crystallise potential alternatives to the seemingly unending vortex of underdevelopment and poverty in third and second world nations, an understanding of the deficiencies and insufficiencies of the current macroeconomic arrangement is an obvious starting point. The post-Bretton Woods monetary consensus, which promised to guarantee mutual &amp;lsquo;real growth&amp;rsquo; through endless liberalization of domestic markets and fluctuating exchange rates, has in whole been failure for developing countries. Instead, of self-sufficiency and self-confidence, there isn&amp;rsquo;t even what one one called &amp;lsquo;multi-lateral beneficence&amp;rsquo;, but rather, a reliance and dependency on the most powerful players in the game, at the mercy of commodities swings and speculative exuberance (rather than being &amp;rsquo;liberated&amp;rsquo; and domestically sound, buffered from &amp;lsquo;shocks&amp;rsquo;).</description>
