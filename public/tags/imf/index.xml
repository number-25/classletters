      <description>Teresa Hayter&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Aid as Imperialism&amp;rsquo;, was one of the first somewhat critical texts written about the post world-war II monetary institutions, from a so called insider&amp;rsquo;s view.

Although the book is more of an essay containing fragmentary thoughts, I found this chapter substantial in the sense that it clearly outlined the various institutional avenues in which projects such as neoliberalism cement their ideology.&#xA;This chapter considers the global emergence of neoliberalism. It looks at the ways in which neoliberal practice has emerged, expanded and established for itself ‘paradigmatic’ status.</description>
