      <description>This post will be in two parts, both of which I find are illustrative of the difficulties of public health strategies. One makes particularly obvious the severe misanthropic consequences of profit seeking drives in the areas of health and medicine, and the second is a remarkable case point in the iatrogenic potential of public health interventions which may be completely benevolent in intention &amp;ndash; something that all states irrespective of political structure must address.</description>

      <title>Cancer Prevention and Screening by Jason Fung; The Cancer Code</title>

      <description>This is part 2 of the post on Jason Fung&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Cancer Code&amp;rsquo;. I found this a remarkable case point in the iatrogenic potential of public health interventions in which the effect on mortality is masked by an early surrogate of survival; early detection. One tracked for long enough time, early detection does more harm than good, and thus, fails as a successful surrogate. You can find part one here.
I encourage everyone to read the entirety of Jason&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Cancer Code&amp;rdquo;.</description>
