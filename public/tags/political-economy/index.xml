      <description>Teresa Hayter&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Aid as Imperialism&amp;rsquo;, was one of the first somewhat critical texts written about the post world-war II monetary institutions, from a so called insider&amp;rsquo;s view. Having spent some time employed at the Overseas Development Institute, the World Bank financed Teresa&amp;rsquo;s research on the effectiveness of aid packages provided to Third World countries.

      <description>In looking to imagine and crystallise potential alternatives to the seemingly unending vortex of underdevelopment and poverty in third and second world nations, an understanding of the deficiencies and insufficiencies of the current macroeconomic arrangement is an obvious starting point. The post-Bretton Woods monetary consensus, which promised to guarantee mutual &amp;lsquo;real growth&amp;rsquo; through endless liberalization of domestic markets and fluctuating exchange rates, has in whole been failure for developing countries. Instead, of self-sufficiency and self-confidence, there isn&amp;rsquo;t even what one one called &amp;lsquo;multi-lateral beneficence&amp;rsquo;, but rather, a reliance and dependency on the most powerful players in the game, at the mercy of commodities swings and speculative exuberance (rather than being &amp;rsquo;liberated&amp;rsquo; and domestically sound, buffered from &amp;lsquo;shocks&amp;rsquo;).</description>

      <description>Original at https://acoup.blog/2022/08/26/collections-why-no-roman-industrial-revolution/ . Linked to it via Paul Cockshott.&#xA;The Question That said this is a question that is not absurd a priori. As we’ll see, the Roman Empire was never close to an industrial revolution – a great many of the preconditions were missing – but the idea that it might have been on the cusp of being something like a modern economy did once have its day in the scholarship.</description>
