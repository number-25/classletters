      <description>Chapter five from Breeding Superman: Nietzsche, Race and Eugenics in Edwardian and Interwar Britain by Dan Stone.&#xA;As we have seen, before the First World War, and in some circles until well into the interwar period, eugenics &amp;mdash; literally, ‘well born’ or ‘good stocks’&amp;mdash; was the height of sophisticated, ‘progressive’ thought.1 Across Europe, the novels and plays of the period, such as H.

From this perspective, Marxism’s most important contri- bution to making sense of race and racism in the United States may be demystification. A histori- cal materialist perspective should stress that “race”—which includes “racism,” as one is unthinkable without the other—is a historically specific ideology that emerged, took shape, and has evolved as a constitutive element within a definite set of social relations anchored to a par- ticular system of production.</description>
