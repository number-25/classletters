It was a fine autumn morning such as encouraged friendliness to passing strangers. Brisk youngsters were hurrying in all directions, many of them obviously freshmen in their first flush of enthusiasm.An older man going the same way as I turned and remarked to me how very young they came these days.</p>

                <p>I see this as a terrific example of where reasoned and well formed criticism can stand on its own, in spite of the divergent trajectory which the author appears to take later on in his life through his reactionary offshoots.
As with any analytical field of inquiry which aspires to achieving insights, syntheses and increased understandings of the world, Marxism contains a broad array of unique and differeing perspectives, some of which fall far short of the high standard of rigor demanded of a scientific field.</p>

                <p>Class Letters seeks to be a regularly updated feed of articles, unified by the goal of building a socialist~communist consciousness, itself thereafter seeking a real body politic.
Alongside more clearly defined political and philosophical texts, Class Letters incorporates works from different scientific, and health fields, bound by the commitment that communist work can, and should be scientific. Without a doubt, there is a purposeful goal of educating, and the goals of the autodidact are encouraged &ndash; we have a reverence for education and it&rsquo;s transformative potentials.</p>

                <p>In looking to imagine and crystallise potential alternatives to the seemingly unending vortex of underdevelopment and poverty in third and second world nations, an understanding of the deficiencies and insufficiencies of the current macroeconomic arrangement is an obvious starting point. The post-Bretton Woods monetary consensus, which promised to guarantee mutual &lsquo;real growth&rsquo; through endless liberalization of domestic markets and fluctuating exchange rates, has in whole been failure for developing countries. Instead, of self-sufficiency and self-confidence, there isn&rsquo;t even what one one called &lsquo;multi-lateral beneficence&rsquo;, but rather, a reliance and dependency on the most powerful players in the game, at the mercy of commodities swings and speculative exuberance (rather than being &rsquo;liberated&rsquo; and domestically sound, buffered from &lsquo;shocks&rsquo;).</p>

                <p>This is part 2 of the post on Jason Fung&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cancer Code&rsquo;. I found this a remarkable case point in the iatrogenic potential of public health interventions in which the effect on mortality is masked by a surrogate of survival; early detection. When tracked for long enough time, early detection does more harm than good, and thus, fails as a successful surrogate. You can find part one here.

One makes particularly obvious the severe misanthropic consequences of profit seeking drives in the areas of health and medicine, and the second is a remarkable case point in the iatrogenic potential of public health interventions which may be completely benevolent in intention &ndash; something that all states irrespective of political structure must address.</p>

The Question That said this is a question that is not absurd a priori. As we‚Äôll see, the Roman Empire was never close to an industrial revolution ‚Äì a great many of the preconditions were missing ‚Äì but the idea that it might have been on the cusp of being something like a modern economy did once have its day in the scholarship.</p>

From this perspective, Marxism‚Äôs most important contri- bution to making sense of race and racism in the United States may be demystification. A histori- cal materialist perspective should stress that ‚Äúrace‚Äù‚Äîwhich includes ‚Äúracism,‚Äù as one is unthinkable without the other‚Äîis a historically specific ideology that emerged, took shape, and has evolved as a constitutive element within a definite set of social relations anchored to a par- ticular system of production.</p>
