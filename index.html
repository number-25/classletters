Alongside more clearly defined political and philosophical texts, Class Letters incorporates works from different scientific, and health fields, bound by the commitment that communist work can, and should be scientific. Without a doubt, there is a purposeful goal of educating, and the goals of the autodidact are encouraged &ndash; we have a reverence for education and it&rsquo;s transformative potentials.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 16, 2024</time>

The post-Bretton Woods monetary consensus, which promised to guarantee mutual &lsquo;real growth&rsquo; through endless liberalization of domestic markets and fluctuating exchange rates, has in whole been failure for developing countries. Instead, of self-sufficiency and self-confidence, there isn&rsquo;t even what one one called &lsquo;multi-lateral beneficence&rsquo;, but rather, a reliance and dependency on the most powerful players in the game, at the mercy of commodities swings and speculative exuberance (rather than being &rsquo;liberated&rsquo; and domestically sound, buffered from &lsquo;shocks&rsquo;).</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 8, 2024</time>

I found this a remarkable case point in the iatrogenic potential of public health interventions in which the effect on mortality is masked by a surrogate of survival; early detection. When tracked for long enough time, early detection does more harm than good, and thus, fails as a successful surrogate. You can find part one here.
I encourage everyone to read the entirety of Jason&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Cancer Code&rdquo;.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 28, 2024</time>

One makes particularly obvious the severe misanthropic consequences of profit seeking drives in the areas of health and medicine, and the second is a remarkable case point in the iatrogenic potential of public health interventions which may be completely benevolent in intention &ndash; something that all states irrespective of political structure must address.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 18, 2024</time>

Linked to it via Paul Cockshott.
The Question That said this is a question that is not absurd a priori. As we’ll see, the Roman Empire was never close to an industrial revolution – a great many of the preconditions were missing – but the idea that it might have been on the cusp of being something like a modern economy did once have its day in the scholarship.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 8, 2024</time>

Rossini crowned a brilliant operatic career with William Tell and then wrote almost nothing for the next thirty-five years.

Charles Darwin developed a radical theory of evolution in 1838 and published it twenty-one years later only because A.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>January 31, 2024</time>

Author and reader may well ask why they should be republished just now. At first sight they might seem to lack all topicality. Subject and tone alike may appear remote to a considerable section of public opinion. I believe, however, that they have some topicality in that, without entering upon any detailed polemics, they represent a point of view in opposition to certain literary and philosophical trends still very much to the fore today.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>September 29, 2023</time>

From this perspective, Marxism’s most important contri- bution to making sense of race and racism in the United States may be demystification. A histori- cal materialist perspective should stress that “race”—which includes “racism,” as one is unthinkable without the other—is a historically specific ideology that emerged, took shape, and has evolved as a constitutive element within a definite set of social relations anchored to a par- ticular system of production.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>September 24, 2023</time>

I was put onto this article from the reading of the terrific text on the Cuban and Venezuelan healthcare systems and practices by Steven Brouwer: &ldquo;Revolutionary Doctors: How Venezuela and Cuba Are Changing the World’s Conception of Health Care&rdquo;
This simple celebration, another among the hundreds of public functions with which the Cuban people daily celebrate their liberty, the progress of all their revolutionary laws, and their advances along the road to complete independence, is of special interest to me.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>August 3, 2023</time>

I would say it speaks for itself.
Many subdividers also employed restrictions to exclude ‘‘undesirable’’ people as well as &ldquo;undesirable&rdquo; activities. By far the most common of these provisions were racial covenants. Under a typical covenant, an owner was forbidden to sell or lease the property to a member of any of a number of allegedly undesirable racial, ethnic, or religious groups.</p></div><div class=post-footer><time>July 9, 2023</time>
