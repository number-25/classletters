Myth of the Market Economy</em>&rdquo;, a book that offers a critique of what a &lsquo;market
economy&rsquo; is purported to be, through an evaluation of the strategies and
economic histories of businesses within what can be called &ldquo;actually existing
capitalism&rdquo;.</p><hr><p>Here, at the risk of a small amount of
repetition, I shall supplement that discussion by focusing on the nature
of fixed costs, the different sources of uncertainty the innovative organization faces, and the relation between organizational capability and technological change.
Through its investment activities, a business organization commits financial resources to specific processes to make particular products with
the expectation of reaping financial returns. Once they are committed,
the productive assets of the organization represent fixed costs that must
then be recouped by the production and sale of output. If, through the
sale of sufficient output, investments could generate expected financial
returns instantaneously, fixed costs would not represent an economic
problem to the organization. But then, we would probably not call the
“assets” underlying these costs “investments.” Indeed, we might not even
deem it appropriate to call these costs “fixed” or the entity that incurs
them a firm. The problem of fixed costs occurs because the production
and sale of the enterprise’s output occur neither instantaneously nor with
certainty. The basic economic problem that confronts the capitalist enterprise is to transform fixed costs into revenue-generating products to realize financial returns. An analysis of how and with what success the business organization manages this transformation is the key to understanding
technological change, value creation, and economic growth.</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 16, 2025</time>

into the interwar period, eugenics &mdash; literally, ‘well born’ or ‘good stocks’&mdash; was the height of sophisticated, ‘progressive’ thought.<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> Across Europe, the
novels and plays of the period, such as H. G. Wells’s <em>The New Machiavelli</em>
(1911) and George Bernard Shaw’s <em>Man and Superman</em> (1905), are suffused
with the language of race-regeneration and fears of physical deterioration. In
Arthur Schnitzler’s novel, <em>The Road to the Open</em> (1908), Berthold Stauber, a
young and enthusiastic Viennese Jewish physician, tells his father, the
humane Dr Stauber, that ‘You need only consider, father, that the most
honest and consistent social hygiene would have the direct result of annihilating diseased people, or at any rate excluding them from all enjoyment of
life, and I don’t deny that I have all kinds of ideas tending in that way which
may seem cruel at the first glance.’ He went on to say that ‘You needn’t be
afraid, father, that I shall begin straight away to preach the murder of the
unhealthy and superfluous. But theoretically that’s certainly what my programme leads to.’<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> Although primarily a conservative ideology, both left and
right were attracted to eugenic proposals. These ranged from ‘positive’ measures such as the encouragement of ‘hygienic marriage’, that is, marriage
between two people of good stock, to ‘negative’ measures such as sterilisation or segregation in order to ensure that the unfit, feeble-minded and
morally degenerate did not have children. In this chapter I will consider
eugenics in general, before concentrating on one aspect of its rhetoric which
to a post-Second World War audience is perhaps even more shocking than it
was to an Edwardian one.</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>February 2, 2025</time>

Revolution, which is creating in the countryside and in the towns not only a

It was a fine
autumn morning such as encouraged friendliness to passing strangers. Brisk
youngsters were hurrying in all directions, many of them obviously freshmen in their first flush of enthusiasm.An older man going the same way as I
turned and remarked to me how very young they came these days. I agreed.
Then he asked me if I was a student too. I said, no, I was a teacher.What did
I teach? African literature. Now that was funny, he said, because he knew a
fellow who taught the same thing, or perhaps it was African <em>history</em>, in a certain community college not far from here. It always surprised him, he went
on to say, because he never had thought of Africa as having that kind of
stuff, you know. By this time I was walking much faster. “Oh well,” I heard
him say finally, behind me: “I guess I have to take your course to find out.”</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>September 22, 2024</time>

can stand on its own, in spite of the divergent trajectory which the author
appears to take later on in his life through his reactionary offshoots.</p><p>As with any analytical field of inquiry which aspires to achieving insights, syntheses and increased understandings of the world, Marxism contains a broad array of unique and differeing perspectives, some of which fall far short of the high standard of rigor demanded of a scientific field. Here, Geras addresses several lazy and incongruent arguments put forward by Marxists who are themselves claiming to remedy pitfalls in Marx&rsquo;s views; a public purging of sorts, these types of obloquy.</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>June 29, 2024</time>

unending vortex of underdevelopment and poverty in third and second world
nations, an understanding of the deficiencies and insufficiencies of the
current macroeconomic arrangement is an obvious starting point. The
post-Bretton Woods monetary consensus, which promised to guarantee mutual &lsquo;real
growth&rsquo; through endless liberalization of domestic markets and fluctuating exchange rates, has in whole been
failure for developing countries. Instead, of self-sufficiency and
self-confidence, there isn&rsquo;t even what one one called &lsquo;multi-lateral
beneficence&rsquo;, but rather, a reliance and dependency on the most powerful players in the game, at the mercy of commodities swings and speculative exuberance
(rather than being &rsquo;liberated&rsquo; and domestically sound, buffered from &lsquo;shocks&rsquo;). One wonders what one
would do if they swapped shoes. What shall we do once we take control of these
responsibilities?</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>May 8, 2024</time>

I found this a
remarkable case point in the iatrogenic potential of public health
interventions in which the effect on mortality is masked by a surrogate
of survival; early detection. When tracked for long enough time, early detection
does more harm than good, and thus, fails as a successful surrogate. You can
find part one

terrific work of &lsquo;popular&rsquo; scientific writing, a story as much about
the biology of Cancer as it is about the sociology of biomedical practice and
research.</p></p></div><div class=post-footer><time>March 28, 2024</time>
